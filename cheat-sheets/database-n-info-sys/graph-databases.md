#	Additional Information

+ [multi-model database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-model_database)
	- "In the field of database design, a multi-model database is a database management system designed to support multiple data models against a single, integrated backend."
	- "Document, graph, relational, and keyâ€“value models are examples of data models that may be supported by a multi-model database."
+ [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore)
	- "A triplestore or RDF store is a purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of triples[1] through semantic queries. A triple is a data entity composed of subjectâ€“predicateâ€“object, like "Bob is 35" (i.e., Bob's age measured in years is 35) or "Bob knows Fred"."
