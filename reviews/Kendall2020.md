##	Introduction


pp. ix-xviii  (official, from the paper version)
+ pp. 10
	- First paragraph resonates with me. It starts with "There's probably some value in being seen as a good girl" and ends with "My feminism doesn't center on those who are comfortable with the status quo because ultimately that road can never lead to equity for girls like me."
		* It addresses using moral suasion to keep girls and women of color "in their place." 
	- Second paragraph.
		* Tone policing, coupled with moral suasion, affects the mental health of the more marginalized (and/or less privileged), which consequently affects physical health of these people groups.
		* Tone policing and moral suasion are also weaponized to make it very hard for the more marginalized and/or less privileged to engage in self advocacy, protect themselves from harassment and discrimination, and exercise their right to be subjected to due process.
	- Third paragraph.
		* Challenging to walk the fine line between self- advocacy/protection and acting out due to increasing frustration of being subjected to much higher standards of ethical conduct and greater frequency of being screened for compliance to such hypocritical standards of conduct.
+ pp. 11
	- First paragraph.
		* I love the last sentence.
			+ "Feminism is the work that you do, and the people you do it for who matter more than anything else."
		* The second-last sentence is also important.
			+ "It isn't a matter of saying the right words at the right time."
	- Second paragraph.
		* This is critical, since it addresses the need for a multi-prong approach at different levels of abstract.
	- Third paragraph.
		* ***Absurd dismissal and invalidation of feelings, expressions, and statements from women of color***, including the racist assertation that these women cannot comprehend certain complex terms in feminism or feminist theory, or the English language, such as microaggressions or sentient.
		* ***This supports the need for inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism.***
+ pp. 12
	- Second paragraph.
		* Unfair expectations of women of color, due to tone policing and moral suasion.
			+ These expectations stresses these women out emotionally and physically.
			+ It makes it hard for these women to get adequate rest, help, support, and get their tasks done (due to the exploitation of their time, compassion, generosity, finances, and effort). Consequently, it builds up pressure in these women that makes them vulnerable to mental health challenges, physical health problems, further exploitation, and increases their desire to abandon increasingly impossible-to-fulfill responsibilities..
	- Third paragraph.
		* Problems of weaponizing tone policing to cover up their racism, and mitigate effort to address inclusive feminism, intersectional feminism, inclusive diversity, equity, and belonging. It stresses out the more marginalized and/or less privileged women.
+ pp. 13
	- First paragraph.
		* We need to be able to differentiate different types of discomfort, including good types of discomfort.
		* examples of good discomfort:
			+ craving for super-sweet, high-calorie drinks and dessert/food, while cutting intake of such drinks and dessert/food.
			+ learning a new language
			+ being disciplined to learn better conduct, procedures, and execution of processes/methodologies.
			+ while/when exercising
			+ guilt that leads to repentance
			+ learning about about our bias, willful ignorance, discriminatory behavior (conscious or subconscious), and microagressions that affect out ability to build up communities that value inclusive diversity, equity, and belonging
		* examples of bad discomfort:
			+ shame or guilt that leads to defensive justification of sexism, racism, and/or ableism
			+ guilt of giving up good dietary practices to binge eat on unhealthy food, such as super-sweet, high-calorie drinks and dessert/food
			+ physical discomfort that leads to giving up good habits of exercise and physical training
		* Ignoring and invalidating the hurt of marginalized and less privileged people, and suppressing research/studies on the impact of bias and discrimination on these marginalized and less privileged people, while ignoring facts, logical reasoning, and valid data, would make it more difficult to rally feminists behind advocating and sponsoring such women.
+ pp. 14
	- First paragraph.
		* Need to address financial and educational elitism, (ableism, and anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiments) among more privileged and less marginalized women.
+ pp. 15
	- ***The book is about inclusive and intersectional feminism.***







##	Solidarity is Still for White Women



pp. 1-14 (official, from the paper version)
+ pp. 16
	- First paragraph.
		* Feminism cannot be limited to address the needs and interests of middle-class and upper-class White women in the United States, and countries with a lot of people of European descent (such as Canada, European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa).
			+ reproductive needs
		* It has to address the problems that other women of less privilege, or more marginalized women, such as the following.
			+ food insecurity
			+ education
			+ health care
		* Need for ***inclusive and intersectional feminism***.
	- Second paragraph.
		* White feminism centers the interests of middle-class and upper-class White women at the expense of other women, from women of color to lower-income women and disabled women
		* White feminism is cast as mainstream feminism
			+ "mainstream White feminism" prioritizes achieving socioeconomic equity for (able-bodied, cisgendered, heterosexual), middle-class and upper-class White women before other women, even when other women have less privilege and are more marginalized
		* (able-bodied, cisgendered, heterosexual), middle-class and upper-class White women responded to calls for inclusive and intersectional feminism by asserting that such inclusive feminists are divisive and such calls lead to infighting, as opposed to acknowledging and mitigating/addressing the problems of racism, ableism, anti-LGBTQIA+ bias and discrimination, and socioeconomic class discrimination (or financial/academic elitism).
+ pp. 17
	- Second paragraph.
		* Highlights some problems that women of color and LGBTQIA+ women (specifically trans women) face.
	- Third paragraph.
		* To address the problems of non-inclusive, or exclusive, feminism, we need to change/evolve our priorities to address more pressing needs with greater priority.
		* address the following needs with more priority and importance:
			+ housing
			+ food
			+ clothing
			* public transportation
			* public education
			* income equity
		* to strive for income equity, and wealth equity, we need to improve education to help women get better jobs for high-skilled professionals
			+ the argument assumes that the number and quality of job opportunities is proportional to the level of selected professional education (degrees for medicine, law, engineering) and/or research skills (e.g., in computer science, engineering, biochemistry, and biotechnology)
+ pp. 18
	- First paragraph.
		* address the need to pivot to ***inclusive and intersectional feminism*** by:
			+ addressing respectability politics that is used to value/prioritize White feminism over inclusive/intersectional feminism, and consequently indicate that a subset of women deserve respect and protection
				- people from marginalized people groups, or less privileged people, "internally police members" of their community to pressure them to align with the norms of the dominant culture
				- respectability politics keeps us from addressing the needs of the following groups of women:
					* sex workers
					* incarcerated women, and formerly incarcerated women
					* women who had to face (multiple)
