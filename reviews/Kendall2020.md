##	Introduction


pp. ix-xviii  (official, from the paper version)
+ pp. 10
	- First paragraph resonates with me. It starts with "There's probably some value in being seen as a good girl" and ends with "My feminism doesn't center on those who are comfortable with the status quo because ultimately that road can never lead to equity for girls like me."
		* It addresses using moral suasion to keep girls and women of color "in their place." 
		* (pp. xi, second/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Second paragraph.
		* Tone policing, coupled with moral suasion, affects the mental health of the more marginalized (and/or less privileged), which consequently affects physical health of these people groups.
		* Tone policing and moral suasion are also weaponized to make it very hard for the more marginalized and/or less privileged to engage in self advocacy, protect themselves from harassment and discrimination, and exercise their right to be subjected to due process.
		* (pp. xii, first paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* Challenging to walk the fine line between self- advocacy/protection and acting out due to increasing frustration of being subjected to much higher standards of ethical conduct and greater frequency of being screened for compliance to such hypocritical standards of conduct.
		* (pp. xii, second/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 11
	- First paragraph.
		* I love the last sentence.
			+ "Feminism is the work that you do, and the people you do it for who matter more than anything else."
		* The second-last sentence is also important.
			+ "It isn't a matter of saying the right words at the right time."
		* (pp. xiii, first paragraph that started on the previous page)
	- Second paragraph.
		* This is critical, since it addresses the need for a multi-prong approach at different levels of abstract.
		* (pp. 2, second paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* ***Absurd dismissal and invalidation of feelings, expressions, and statements from women of color***, including the racist assertation that these women cannot comprehend certain complex terms in feminism or feminist theory, or the English language, such as microaggressions or sentient.
		* ***This supports the need for inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism.***
			+ inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism would include:
				- postcolonial feminism
				- Black feminism
				- African feminism
				- triple oppression
					* or, double jeopardy
					* or, Jane Crow
					* or, triple exploitation
					* challenges ***kyriarchy***
		* (pp. xiii, second/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 12
	- Second paragraph.
		* Unfair expectations of women of color, due to tone policing and moral suasion.
			+ These expectations stresses these women out emotionally and physically.
			+ It makes it hard for these women to get adequate rest, help, support, and get their tasks done (due to the exploitation of their time, compassion, generosity, finances, and effort). Consequently, it builds up pressure in these women that makes them vulnerable to mental health challenges, physical health problems, further exploitation, and increases their desire to abandon increasingly impossible-to-fulfill responsibilities..
		* (pp. xiv, third/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Third paragraph.
		* Problems of weaponizing tone policing to cover up their racism, and mitigate effort to address inclusive feminism, intersectional feminism, inclusive diversity, equity, and belonging. It stresses out the more marginalized and/or less privileged women.
		* (pp. xv, second paragraph)
+ pp. 13
	- First paragraph.
		* We need to be able to differentiate different types of discomfort, including good types of discomfort.
		* examples of good discomfort:
			+ craving for super-sweet, high-calorie drinks and dessert/food, while cutting intake of such drinks and dessert/food.
			+ learning a new language
			+ being disciplined to learn better conduct, procedures, and execution of processes/methodologies.
			+ while/when exercising
			+ guilt that leads to repentance
			+ learning about about our bias, willful ignorance, discriminatory behavior (conscious or subconscious), and microagressions that affect out ability to build up communities that value inclusive diversity, equity, and belonging
		* examples of bad discomfort:
			+ shame or guilt that leads to defensive justification of sexism, racism, and/or ableism
			+ guilt of giving up good dietary practices to binge eat on unhealthy food, such as super-sweet, high-calorie drinks and dessert/food
			+ physical discomfort that leads to giving up good habits of exercise and physical training
		* Ignoring and invalidating the hurt of marginalized and less privileged people, and suppressing research/studies on the impact of bias and discrimination on these marginalized and less privileged people, while ignoring facts, logical reasoning, and valid data, would make it more difficult to rally feminists behind advocating and sponsoring such women.
		* (pp. xvii, third/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 14
	- First paragraph.
		* Need to address financial and educational elitism, (ableism, and anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiments) among more privileged and less marginalized women.
		* (pp. xvii, first paragraph)
+ pp. 15
	- ***The book is about inclusive and intersectional feminism.***
	* (pp. xviii, third/last paragraph)







##	Solidarity is Still for White Women



pp. 1-14 (official, from the paper version)
+ pp. 16
	- First paragraph.
		* Feminism cannot be limited to address the needs and interests of middle-class and upper-class White women in the United States, and countries with a lot of people of European descent (such as Canada, European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa).
			+ reproductive needs
		* It has to address the problems that other women of less privilege, or more marginalized women, such as the following.
			+ food insecurity
			+ education
			+ health care
		* Need for ***inclusive and intersectional feminism***.
		* (pp. 1, first paragraph)
	- Second paragraph.
		* White feminism centers the interests of middle-class and upper-class White women at the expense of other women, from women of color to lower-income women and disabled women
		* White feminism is cast as mainstream feminism
			+ "mainstream White feminism" prioritizes achieving socioeconomic equity for (able-bodied, cisgendered, heterosexual), middle-class and upper-class White women before other women, even when other women have less privilege and are more marginalized
		* (able-bodied, cisgendered, heterosexual), middle-class and upper-class White women responded to calls for inclusive and intersectional feminism by asserting that such inclusive feminists are divisive and such calls lead to infighting, as opposed to acknowledging and mitigating/addressing the problems of racism, ableism, anti-LGBTQIA+ bias and discrimination, and socioeconomic class discrimination (or financial/academic elitism).
			+ attacks on inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism are also used to attack the following:
				- postcolonial feminism
		* (pp. 1, second/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 17
	- Second paragraph.
		* Highlights some problems that women of color and LGBTQIA+ women (specifically trans women) face.
		* (pp. 2, second paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Third paragraph.
		* To address the problems of non-inclusive, or exclusive, feminism, we need to change/evolve our priorities to address more pressing needs with greater priority.
		* address the following needs with more priority and importance:
			+ housing
			+ food
			+ clothing
			+ public transportation
			+ public education
			+ income equity
		* to strive for income equity, and wealth equity, we need to improve education to help women get better jobs for high-skilled professionals
			+ the argument assumes that the number and quality of job opportunities is proportional to the level of selected professional education (degrees for medicine, law, engineering) and/or research skills (e.g., in computer science, engineering, biochemistry, and biotechnology)
		* (pp. 3, second paragraph)
+ pp. 18
	- First paragraph.
		* address the need to pivot to ***inclusive and intersectional feminism*** by:
			+ addressing respectability politics that is used to value/prioritize White feminism over inclusive/intersectional feminism, and consequently indicate that a subset of women deserve respect and protection
				- people from marginalized people groups, or less privileged people, "internally police members" of their community to pressure them to align with the norms of the dominant culture
				- respectability politics keeps us from addressing the needs of the following groups of women:
					* sex workers
					* incarcerated women, and formerly incarcerated women
					* women who had to face (multiple) hard life choices
				- White feminism, or mainstream feminism, uses paths/options dictated by White men, rather tha address the needs of all women groups, including the more marginalized and less privileged
					* all women desrves help, regardless if they are employed, part-time or full-time
						* stay-at-home parents deserve help, just like workers/professionals
		* (pp. 3, third/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Second paragraph:
		* Not all women-identifying people have the same set of challenges, including challenges in the context of reproductive health
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, focuses on cisgender able-bodied White women in the developed world
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, excludes:
				- trans-women
				- intersex people, and other people with bodies that don't fit the biological classification of male or women based on their genitalia
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, fails to address:
				- employment equity statistics
					* income equity
						* White American women make less than White American men
						* American women of color make less than White American women
				- other socioeconomic equity statistics
					* wealth equity
				- complaints about affirmative action policies:
					* including complaints by White American women about how people of color benefit from these policies far more than others, even though White American women benefit from affirmative action policies far more than others
				- failure to use their privilege as the most privileged people group (cisgender able-bodied White American women), among oppressed people groups, to advocate for and sponsor people of color, ... disabled people
		* (pp. 4, second paragraph)
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page:
		* White American women use racist myth of "Black American women being stronger" to justify prioritizing themselves (i.e., White American women) over women of color (in the U.S. and elsewhere)
			+ Such White American women claim that they need feminist support more than women of color (in the U.S. and elsewhere), since women of color "can handle" more "abuse and ignorance", and have less urgent care and concern
		* (pp. 4, third/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 19
	- First paragraph.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women are trained/taught to center feminism on themselves
			+ These are well documented in mass media.
		* (pp. 5, first paragraph)
	- Second paragraph.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women are trained/taught to center attention on themselves
				- This is an unspoken assumption.
				- People of color need to give them attention, whenever they want the attention, and to be absent from the lives of White American women when they want the absence
				- White American women need to learn to listen to:
					* people of color, in general
					* women of color, particularly Black American women
					* men of color, who they have the power to oppress
				- White American women, or White Americans in general, do not want to acknowledge the racist history of:
					* men of color, not just Black American men, are being demonized or killed for expressing romantic/sexual interest in White women
					* tears of White (American) women can adversely affect the careers and lives of men/people of color, particularly Black American men
		* (pp. 5, second paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women, or White Americans in general, do not want to acknowledge the racist history of:
				- men of color, not just Black American men, are being demonized or killed for expressing romantic/sexual interest in White women
				- asserting all women should unite and support each other, without supporting inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism, and without seeking equity by giving less privileged and more marginalized women more priority
		* (pp. 6, second paragraph)
+ pp. 20
	- Second paragraph.
		* inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism differ from White feminism, or mainstream feminism, since they:
			+ are anti-racist
			+ good/neutral intentions by White people/Americans are worthless when compared to the considerable adversarial impact (of their speech and/or actions) on people/women of color
				- such considerable adversarial impact are not experienced by White people/Americans/women
		* (pp. 6, third paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women need to learn that:
				- sisterhood or solidarity cannot function as one sided
				- they have to be humble enough to accept critical feedback, critique, and be told that they are wrong when they are wrong
				- not all critiques are unjustified attacks
				- they should not center themselves at the center of the struggles of women of color, and other marginalized women groups (e.g., disabled women)
		* (pp. 6, fourth paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Fourth paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women need to learn that:
				- White feminist, or mainstream feminist, rhetoric is rooted in the following biases:
					* racism
					* ableism
					* transmisogyny
					* anti-Semitism
					* Islamophobia
				- the aforementioned biases marginalize women who are not cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women
				- people's identities do intersect
					* e.g., disabled, immigrant women of color
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, hurts marginalized women
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, makes it very challenging for marginalized women to support sisterhood or solidarity (with White American women)
		* (pp. 7, second paragraph)
+ pp. 21
	- First paragraph.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ need to shift from pitying and empathizing into ***scalable compassion***
			+ address systemic/structural inequity:
				- for access to affordable, high-quality K-12 schools and colleges/universities
				- for access to opportunities for personal and professional development, protection, advocacy, sponsorship
			+ go beyond merely studying systemic/structural inequity to create and effectively implement policies to mitigate such inequity
			+ ***stop weaponizing tone policing, moral suasion, and respectability politics to keep feminism from being inclusive and intersectional***
				- respectability politics won't save women from sexism and misogyny, and women of color from racism by White (American) women
			+ when White (American) women fail to address their harmful behavior (such as racism, anti-immigrant bias, and ableism), they make it hard for marginalized women to enthusiastically collaborate with highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women
				- "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is not necessarily true
				- "the enemy of my enemy may be my enemy as well"
				- caught in these spats between groups of women mean that sexist and misogynistic men can use "divide and conquer" to keep women from uniting against ***kyriarchy***
		* (pp. 7, third paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Second paragraph.
		* feminists of all identities have to address would-be allies in what they seek in inclusive and intersectional feminism
		* allies, from people who are not cisgender women to White (American) women, have to learn to listen and respect people who we choose to help
		* more privileged feminist cannot embrace or propagate savior myths
		* solidarity cannot include:
			+ people who disagree with common goals
			+ people who cannot work in partnership with inclusive and intersectional feminists
		* equal partners in inclusive and intersectional feminism:
			+ can negotiate
			+ can compromise
			+ can build genuine friendship
				- this takes:
					* time
					* effort
					* willingness to accept that some places are not for you/me
		* (pp. 8, second paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* "\#solidarityisforwhitewomen" is a hashtag that addresses the need for inclusive and intersectional feminism:
			+ "It is a rhetorical shorthand for the reality that:"
				- White (American) women can oppress women of color (in the U.S. and elsewhere)
				- heterosexual women can oppress LGBTQIA+ women
				- cisgender women can oppress transgender women
			+ identities can intersect/overlap
			+ the ways in which women can help or harm each other can also intersect
		* (pp. 8, third paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 22
	- First paragraph.
		* failures to embrace inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism creates opportunities for more privileged women to denounce other women as not being "real" feminists:
			+ driven by fetishization and appropriation of cultures and bodies of color
			+ ***feminism that is not inclusive nor intersectional would not empower all women***
			+ need to address:
				- racism
				- transphobia
				- homophobia
				- ableist
				- classist norms
		* none of us are perfect, and each person has flaws
		* Nobody is unaffected/uninfluenced/immune by the socioeconomic/social ecosystem (/environment)
		* We are part of the socioeconomic/social ecosystem or world (/society) that we are trying to make more feminist, and 
		* (pp. 9, first paragraph)
	- Second paragraph.
		* we should not use ***liberation rhetoric*** to advance a group of women at the expense of other women
			+ White privilege is gender neutral, and makes things easier for people with White privilege (including White-passing people to lighter-skinned people of color) in a racialized world
		* the more oppressed women should not be expected to center activism for mostly/only the highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women, and still be expected to serve them as effective slaves (slaves effectively) or indentured servants
		* for less privileged women, we should not embrace the oppressors and discriminate against other oppressed people
			+ From Pastor/Dr. Michael McBride's sermon on September 18, 2022, at The Way Christian Center in (West) Berkeley, California, U.S..
		* (pp. 9, second paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* ***Demands for solidarity (and sisterhood) should not be a one-way expectation.***
			+ Such expectations are tone deaf.
		* (pp. 10, first paragraph)
	- Fourth paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* We should not be expected, let alone forced, to prioritize the comfort of highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women over the lives other women and those of their descendants
			+ These other women are not the "supporting characters in feminism".
			+ Equity among women would not necessarily "trickle down" from highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women to other women
			+ achieving equity between White American women and White American men does not mean that there would be equity between women of color and men of color
		* (pp. 10, second paragraph)
+ pp. 23
	- First paragraph.
		* cultural norms of White feminism, or mainstream feminism, centers on the progress/advancement of more privileged women at the expense of communities of colors
			+ feminism that values individualism and the success of a subset of individuals over the well-being of the community and the world is not inclusive feminism nor intersectional feminism
			+ Consequently, women of color struggle to embrace White feminism, or mainstream feminism, as a model of feminism
				- women of color don't want to have to choose between supporting their loved ones and allies in White feminism, or mainstream feminism
					* sons
					* brothers
					* fathers
					* husbands
					* male friends
				- these male loved ones and friends are not the enemy of women of color
				- these male loved ones and friends also suffer from kyriarchy, and racialized patriarchy
				- the people at and near the top of the hierarchy of kyriarchy, and racialized patriarchy, are not men of color
				- men of color may be responsible for sexism, misogyny, and patriarchy, but they are less responsible for kyriarchy, and racialized patriarchy, than White (American) men
				- men of color are allies/partners in anti-racism
		* (pp. 10, third paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Second paragraph.
		* men of color who recognize and suffer from racism can work to understand sexism, misogyny, and patriarchy impact girls and women
			+ men of color can learn to be feminist, too, and work with feminists to pursue inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism
		* "women in communities of color" have to balance the following:
			+ fight external problematic voices
			+ educate people inside our communities who are bad actors
			+ ***feminism has to do likewise, so that it can be inclusive and intersectional***
		* (pp. 11, first paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* intersectional feminism needs to address identities of women that White feminism, or mainstream feminism, ignores, such as those of:
			+ Black American women
			+ Latinas, or Latinx women
			+ Asian American women
			+ Asian women
			+ indigenous women
			+ other women of color
		* (pp. 11, second paragraph)
	- Fourth paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* Example of how the intersection of sexism and racism may affect women of color first, but eventually the unethical behavior by such perpetrators would affect other women, too, such as White (American) women
		* (pp. 11, third paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 24
	- First paragraph.
		* Amother example in which perpetrators of unethical behavior at the intersection of sexism and racism may affect women of color first, but eventually engage in behavior that affect other women, including White (American) women.
			+ This example is about ***Gamergate***.
		* (pp. 12, first paragraph)
	- Second paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* Despite Donald J. Trump's sexist, racist, classist (as in classism), and anti-Muslim behavior and speech, and foolishness about education (from K-12 education to higher education), more than 50% of White American women supported him in his 2016 bid for the U.S. presidency.
			+ White American women believed his argument that (undocumented) immigrants, people of color, and Muslims are responsible for the problems that the U.S. faces.
			+ White American women believed his argument that he can make life easier for White Americans by making economic (and educational) competition easier for them.
			+ Donald Trump's appeal to the fears and anxieties of White American women worked for his 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
		* (pp. 12, second paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 25
	- First paragraph.
		* The 2016 U.S. Presidential election indicated that White feminism, or mainstream feminism, has failed to prioritize inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism over the fears and anxieties of White American women.
			+ Women of color, especially Black American women, were not surprised by the voting behavior of White American women in this 2016 U.S. Presidential election.
			+ White American women used code words and dog whistle politics to mask their fears, anxieties, and racism and anti-Muslim bias/bigotry.
				- They believed their adjacency to highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American men would benefit them in the resulting socioeconomic and political ecosystem that Donald J. Trump would be shaping. This zero-sum worldview ended up making things bad for everybody, including most White Americans.
		* (pp. 13, first paragraph)
	- Second paragraph.
		* Gail Simone, the writer, is a good example of how to be an ally to women who are not highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women.
			+ She values inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism.
		* (pp. 13, second paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* More details about Gail Simone being a good ally.
		* Solidarity can be described as: "Step up, reach back, and keep pushing forward."
		* (pp. 14, first paragraph)







##	Gun Violence



pp. 15-30 (official, from the paper version)
+ pp. 26
	- Second paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* The exposure of women from lower-income communities to gun violence makes gun violence a feminist issue for (the lives of) many women (now).
		* The availability of access to guns (firearms, ranging from handguns to rifles and machine guns) increases the likelihood of domestic violence incidents that lead to deaths of women.
			+ Handguns include:
				- pistols
				- revolvers
			+ long guns include:
				- muskets
				- submachine guns
				- rifles
					* assault rifles
					* carbines
				- shotgun
		* The impact of gun violence is not limited to men. It affects all of us.
		* When White feminism, or mainstream feminism, fail to address how gun affects women from lower-income communities more than highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women, it remains a failure at becoming inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism.
			+ Consequently, their indifference leads to socioeconomic and political norms that ultimately affect them adversely, too.
			+ E.g., gun violence has become a public health crisis.
			+ highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women have to learn to do the following:
				- listen
				- advocate
				- provide resources
+ pp. 27
	- First paragraph.
		* When racist people pathologize gun violence as a problem belonging to lower-income communities of color, they fail to acknowledge how gun violence also affect all other communities, too.
			+ It discounts the impact of systemic/structural inequity that lead to their challenging circumstances over decades/centuries.
			+ It blames less privileged and marginalized people for circumstances that more privileged people pressured or forced them into.
			+ It fails to address the intersection of systemic/structural racism (and institutional violence) and gun violence.
			+ It fails to address the problems of gun violence, including mass shootings, in other communities and places.
+ pp. 28
	- First paragraph.
		* In lower-income communities, where systemic/structural inequity lead to failures in public policy and education (from K-12 education to higher education), people do not have access to skills, knowledge, professional help, and resources to help them (address and) resolve conflicts peacefully (or even engage in consensus decision making, consensus building), without resorting to violence.
			+ Illegal manufacturing, distribution, and sales of guns contribute to gun violence, and are exacerbated by the illicit/recreational drug trade.
			+ Gun violence in rural areas has increased.
			+ Gun violence in urban areas has decreased.
	- Second paragraph.
		* De facto segregation, let alone de jure segregation, leads to isolation and disenfranchisement of certain racial/ethnic communities.
			+ Disenfranchised communities and people end up growing distrust of law enforcement and public officials who may be mostly indifferent to violence against these marginalized communities/people, or even subject marginalized communities/people to violence.
			+ That said, in rural areas of the U.S., there is a similar distrust of law enforcement and public officials, where prominent gun culture is the norm and hunting with guns is used to obtain food.
			+ Consequently, in rural and urban areas, "gun culture often develops out of necessity."
			+ In rural areas, smaller sized law enforcement staff contribute to the illusion that rural areas are safer than urban areas.
				- This reflects the following macro-level societal biases:
					* comparing communities with different sized populations, without accounting for crimes and other metrics per capita
					* class-based bias
					* race-based bias
				- This does not address the fact that crime rates have been dropping in rural and urban areas in the U.s. for decades.
				- In addition, media bias of crime coverage leads to more media coverage of crime in urban areas than rural areas.
		* Third paragraph.
			+ Racial bias of crime coverage impact our perspectives of communities that are more likely to have crimes.
				- Crimes in "White flight suburbs and former sundown towns" are adequately reported, since the criminals are White Americans.
				- When looking at crime coverage and crime statistics when race is not a statistically significant factor (i.e., "absence of racial diversity", in racially/ethnically homogeneous communities), class becomes the main bias that affect crime coverage (and policy admnistration).
					* Socioeconomic status (e.g., this is influenced by economic class, racial/ethnic category, and gender) of people impact their ability to connect to authorities and other people in positions of power (such as property owners), and consequently impact their sense of safety.
					* By comparing people of the same racial category, class differences center the systemic/structural oppression on the less well-off.
					* Class discrimination among White Americans make "poor White \[Americans\] the target of oppressive structures".
+ pp. 29
	- First paragraph.
		* There are people who excuse poor White Americans from creating (and sustaining) systemic/structural racism, even though these poor White Americans also benefit from systemic/structural racism against people of darker skin tones.
			+ This does not address the important role that these poor White Americans play to sustain these oppressive structures, even if they regularly act (i.e., actions, behavior, and habits) against their self interests.
			+ It also fails to address the unfair and unethical characterization of poor White Americans as "morally and socially inept", without using public policy and institutional policy to shape the worldviews, mindsets, and skills of these poor White Americans to empower them to recognize and mitigate systemic/structural racism and other systemic/structural inequity (such as systemic/structural sexism).
			+ Elitism and classism -based internal oppression among White Americans leave these poor White Americans vulnerable to being brainwashed with racist propaganda that include the following.
				- poorer White Americans need guns to protect themselves from people of color
				- poorer White Americans need guns to protect themselves from criminals and during crimes (or criminal incidents)
				- Racist propaganda about need for guns for protecting (poorer) White Americans leads to the following:
					* This fosters a gun culture that resist better/further/more gun control/regulation.
					* This promotes violence along with gun culture.
					* This promotes gun culture and violence, even if (poorer) White Americans are getting killed by other White Americans via gun violence.
					* Since U.S. history has been defined by (gun) violence, the response of law enforcement to increasing gun violence is the procurement and usage of more guns and more powerful guns to overpower/overwhelm/"outgun" the criminals.
						+ \[In many police departments, this also results in more policing (i.e., more patrols, more racial profiling), which in turns increases distrust between members of communities of color and the police departments.\]
						+ This leads to increasingly militarized police departments that have failed to adequately train police officers how to use these weapons safely, and "that escalation is never a solution".
			+ If poor White Americans found solidarity with people of color living in the U.S., and women, they could effectively challenge these oppressive structures and made it hard for ultra-wealthy people/Americans to use divide & conquer strategies to keep these oppressed people under oppression.
	- Second paragraph.
		* The exposure of children, youth, and teenagers in the U.S. to gun culture and gun violence from crime, in homes, accidents, and suicide affects their ability to pursue an education that helps them grow personally, academically, and professionally.
			+ They are more likely to die of gun violence than their peers outside the U.S..
			+ Likewise for young adults in the U.S. and elsewhere.
			+ The prescence of having a gun at home increases the likelihood of children in the home dying of gun violence -based domestic violence (or, gun-based domestic violence).

		* Black American children, tweens, and teenagers are at a greater risk of being exposed to gun culture and gun violence, and being hurt and killed by gun violence.
			+ They are more likely to be exposed to gun violence in the following places.
				- at home
				- in school
				- in the neighborhood/community
			+ Black American girls and young women are more likely to face the following "double problem" (analogous to "coupled problems" in multiphysics simulation/modeling).
				- being at risk of exposure to gun violence, and 
				- being ignored by mitigation effort to reduce the likelihood of exposure to gun violence
+ pp. 30
	- First paragraph.
		* White feminism, or mainstream feminism, cannot hypocritically support efforts to improve K-12 education of girls outside the U.S., while willfully ignoring the undereducated and uneducated girls in the U.S. due to the exposure and threat of gun violence.
			+ Even if exposure to gun violence did not harm/hurt the girls and (young) women, it still affects them.
			+ Exposure to gun violence causes people to be hypervigilant and anxious of being harmed by gun violence.
			+ The resulting hypervigilance and anxiety can lead to PTSD, and normalize abnormal behavior that are formed from the resulting hypervigilance and anxiety.
			+ While the resulting hypervigilance, anxiety, and PTSD from exposure to gun violence is not uncommon among people who face such exposure, it is still abnormal behavior.

		* Racist gentrifiers who call the police on Black Americans, or people of color, engaged in daily activities can cause these people to die.
			+ However, supporters of White feminism, or mainstream feminism, are not challenging these racist gentrifiers on their racism/prejudice.
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* In order to progress from White feminism, or mainstream feminism, to inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism, and smash the kyriarchy, we need learn and encourage the use of nonviolent means of conflict resolution and consensus building.
			+ Note that the racist (and anti-immigrant) gentrifiers are not limited to: highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women.
			+ Racist and anti-immigrant gentrifiers can be of darker skin complexion, be immgrants themselves (or chldren and grandchildren of immigrants, such as Donald John Trump), and be from any ethnic culture or mix thereof.
				- Compare the bias and prejudice of Africans in Africa (and elsewhere), and immigrants to the U.S. from Africa, against Black Americans who descended from slaves.
					* This has been witnessed and explained by Malcolm X, El-Hajj Malik  El-Shabazz, in his books/speeches, and scholars and authors.
					* A well-documented example.
			+ We need to shape public policy and institutional policies to shift from gun culture and use of violence for conflict resolution towards nonviolent approaches.
			+ We need to call out behavior, actions or inaction, speech or silence, and habits of racist and anti-immigrant gentrifiers, not limited to calling the police to disperse groups of Black Americans and people of color at a social gathering.
			+ We need to improve our support for survivors of intimate partner violence, and educate others about healthy relationships.
			+ We need to mitigate our bias to support (alleged) abusers just because of their ethnic makeup (or ethnicity), citizenship or immigration status, their career or job, their wealth or socioeconomic status (and community standing), by listening to the (potential/actual) survivors of abuse, validating their experiences, and advocating for them.
			+ Recognize people's bias that systemic gun violence is mostly based in certain neighborhoods, and episodic elsewhere.
			+ Multi-pronged, and multi-level approach (from individuals and families to communities and organizations to government agencies at local/regional/national/international levels), to address nonviolent conflict resolution is needed.
+ pp. 36
	- First paragraph.
		* Do not normalize bias, prejudice/hate, regardless of the targeted individual and people group.
		* Note that bias can be amplified over time, and quickly lead to prejudice and hate that results in hate crimes as well as the creation and enforcement of discriminatory policies.
		* Bias and prejudice lead many people to decribe perpetrators of mass shootings by White Americans as people who struggle with mental health, which is problematic for many nonviolent people who struggle with mental health, and perpetrators of color as those with terrible character.
		* Social bubbles keep us from forming relationships that help us progress from White feminism, or mainstream feminism, to inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism, and smash the kyriarchy.
		* Gun culture that tacitly or implicity encourages gun violence is a community health, and public health, issue. It is not just the explicit encouragement of gun violence that is problematic.
	- Second paragraph.
		* We need to do more than treat domestic violence and hate speech as red flags.
		* We need a multi-pronged, and multi-level approach to mitigate community health problems of gun violence, domestic violence, mass shootings, and systemic/structural racism, as feminist issues for inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism.

pp. 31-46 (official, from the paper version)
+ pp. 37
	- First paragraph.
		* Systemic/structural racism, and libertarian racism, has eroded support for public services, including public works (such as free education, public infrastructure, public banks, public hospitals, public spaces, and public K-12 and higher education).
			+ This exacerbates income inequity, and wealth inequity, between cisgender men and cisgender women, and contributes to other forms of inequity, such as those regarding health, education, and the environment.
	- Second paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* Income inequity, and wealth inequity, can keep women from protecting themselves and their loved ones, especially when they fail to get access to public services that they deserve and have paid taxes for.
			+ This makes it very challenging for single Moms.
			+ Using any example, or a small set of examples, of successful single Moms (of color), and expecting all single Moms to do likewise is moral suasion and respectability politics weaponized to enforce or spread systemic/structural inequity/racism and institutional inequity/racism.
+ pp. 38
	- First paragraph.
		* Agencies for child protection services in the U.S. tend to struggle considerably from institutional racism, and contribute significantly to the break up of lower-income families of color.
			+ These agencies tend not to address problems with higher-income families, and target lower-income families of color.
			+ Societal pressure on women, including Moms, make it challenging for single Moms of color, who are the leaders of lower-income families of color, to get help and support.
				- Consequently, they face mental health challenges in addressing expectations of Moms (or caretakers/carers of children, elderly people/parents/grandparents, disabled people, and people with chronic diseases) beyond providing basic needs for their children (or other dependents), such as:
					* basic needs include providing food and shelter for the dependents
					* Christmas tree, and Christmas decorations, for Christmas
						+ or, similar decorations for other festivals
				- when such single Moms of color, or caretakers/carers, have to rely on the following, they feel stressed and anxious for feeling that they are not doing enough for their children/dependents:
					* food banks
					* free of reduced lunches in U.S. K-12 schools (or equivalent)
					* food stamps
				- These Moms and/or caretakers/carers feel pressure when the societal pressure make them feel like the following:
					* criminalized
						+ Treat not-so-rich Moms and caretakers/carers as if they are criminals, by assuming that many/most criminals are from lower-income communities.
					* foolish, since people are poor because they, or their caretakers/carers, probably made foolish choices that caused them to become poor
						+ These not-so-rich Moms and caretakers/carers must have made these foolish choices on purpose, on their own free will, out of their own volition, intentionally, without being pressured or forced or misled to do so.
					* These societal pressure get exacerbated when people from their communities explicitly tell them these.
				- A lot these not-so-rich Moms and caretakers/carers do not have enough information about the choices and opportunities that they have.
					* They also do not have enough opportunities to make other/alternate choices.
					* Support for these not-so-rich Moms and caretakers/carers tend to be:
						+ weak or insubstantial
						+ nonexistent
	- Second paragraph.
		* These not-so-rich Moms and caretakers/carers may be living in ***food deserts***, where they cannot access (highly) affordable fresh produce (farm-produced crops, including fruits, vegetables, and grains).
			+ These food deserts are a result of systemic/structural inequity/racism.
		* These not-so-rich Moms and caretakers/carers may be working long hours or multiple jobs that make it hard for them to prepare food for their children/dependents and clean up afterwards.
		* These not-so-rich Moms and caretakers/carers may also have storage issues for these fresh produce.
		* There could be a variety of conditions that influence how these not-so-rich Moms and caretakers/carers make decisions about what they eat, which are not limited to any (combination) of the following:
			+ lack of basic information about food nutrition
			+ laziness
			+ neglect
			+ living in a community or place that is simultaneously a food desert and ***transit desert*** (or ***transportation desert***)

				- ***libertarian racism*** makes these issues more difficult to discuss, including systemic/structural inequity/racism and institutional inequity/racism, since government agencies and nonprofit organizations (and non-governmental organizations, NGOs) can also create, implement, and enforce certain policies that lead to the creation of certain types of deserts (not landforms, or natural/anthropogenic land features):
					* ***news deserts***, which make its difficult to journalists and media companies to report such systemic/structural inequity/racism and institutional inequity/racism that make it hard for people to learn the facts that lead them to their ignorance (about public policy, their rights, and ) and decision making.
						+ The lack of support from government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) make it hard for people to access this information.
					* ***banking deserts***, where residents of the area/community cannot access adequate banking services
						+ This is not just confined/circumscribed to rural areas
					* ***medical deserts***
						+ places where people have inadequate access to health care (general access, or specific field such as dental services and pharmacies - including community/hospital/clinical pharmacies)
						+ not confined/circumscribed to rural areas, and also exist in urban and suburban areas.
					* ***book deserts***
						+ Communities that have challenges accessing printed books and reading material with private (cars of individuals and families) or public transportation.
					* ***underfunded K-12 public school systems***
					* ***maternity care deserts***

	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* Regarding food deserts, food insecurity extends beyond "the ability to access food" due to "what food costs", as opposed to "what \[can people\] afford".
			+ If people can access grocery stores in their neighborhood/community, but cannot afford food sold there, they still cannot access affordable nutritious food in these stores.
			+ There are dual/twin problems of:
				- hunger, inability to afford enough food to satisfy nutritional needs and hunger pangs
				- nutritional needs, especially in food deserts, where people can access (highly) affordable food, but not food that adequate nutrients that they need
			+ Hunger problems affect people of all age groups:
				- food-insecure children
				- food-insecure college students
				- food-insecure elders
			+ Most households that struggle with hunger are single-Mom households.
+ pp. 39
	- First paragraph.
		* Most of the poor people in the U.S. are:
			+ women
			+ children
		* \[Liberatrian racism advocated by racist people in the U.S., not limited to White supremacists/nationalists, but also immigrants (of color), make it challenging for poorer people to get public services (including social services) that they have paid taxes for.\]
			+ \[The zero-sum worldview(s) of these people, fed to them by rich White supremacists/nationalists, led them to believe that there is a correlation between poor values and poverty, and between poverty and certain communities (such as people of certain ethnic/racial groups).\]
		* Examples of funding cuts by U.S. Federal and state governments for public services, including social services, especially those to support people struggling with unemployment and single-parent families.
			+ Systemic/structural inequity and institutional inequity makes it even harder for part-time workers to seek unemployment insurance.
			+ Charitable organizations have to step in to provide services that local, state, and national governments have failed to provide adquately and/or access to.
	- Second paragraph.
		* Explains the consequences and impact of homelessness on the poorer individuals and families, such as how they can descend into further poverty and associated problems, such as vicious cycles of incurring more and more debt.
			+ Institutional inequity exacerbates this, such as prospective employers requiring job applicants to have a home address.
			+ Inadequate services and support to mitigate the impact of inflation, particularly on rent and food, consequences of rent payment delinquency (such as records of eviction, or personal histories of eviction), and lack of support for child care and parental support (e.g., for maternal and paternal support).
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* White feminism, or mainstream feminism, tend to ignore or delay addressing long/longer -term hunger and food insecurity, while preferring to address women's poverty (due to income inequity and wealth inequity).
+ pp. 40
	- First paragraph.
		* Explains the consequences and impact of hunger on individuals, families, and communities.
			+ Prolonged hunger can lead to desperation that makes it challenging for people facing such hunger to be disciplined in making wiser decisions, avoid losing their composure.
				- Driven by survival instincts, a subset of these people may even commit misdemeanors (minor wrongdoings) or crimes to obtain food or resources/money that can be used to obtain food.
	- Second paragraph.
		* Cases of fraud regarding usage of public/social services (especially public welfare cases) is less than 1% of all public welfare cases.
			+ A small subset of people are pressured to sell food stamps, since the public welfare services do not cover food preparation items (e.g., working refrigerators, stoves, storage solutions, pots, and pans), basic household cleaning and hygiene products, let alone diapers and menstrual pads. Without these other basic necessities, they cannot store, prepare, and consume food that they purchase with the food stamps.
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* Arguments about why poorer people who struggle with food insecurity, including hunger, are ignorant about food nutrition are made by people who are disingenuous and/or willful ignorance about systemic/structural inequity (such as ***food desert and transit/transportation desert***) that lead to food insecurity, including hunger.
			+ This happens "around the world," "not just in \[the United States\]".
			+ To address problems associated with food deserts, protesting against companies that sell food products and provide food services exacerbates the food insecurity and hunger that community members face. This is because if these companies that are providing access to low-nutrition food (or nutrition-lacking food) leave the community or go out of business, the protests end up causing people in the community to have greater food insecurity (unless better companies replaced them).
+ pp. 41
	- First paragraph.
		* White feminism, or mainstream feminism, superficially asserts that it is inclusive (and intersectional).
			+ However, it tends to neglect women with less privilege.
				- It does not advocate for poorer women.
					* Poverty drives people, including women, to do things for money that they would not have done otherwise. They include:
						+ sex work
						+ drug trade
			+ They need to stop using weaponizing tone policing, moral suasion, and respectability politics to oppress less privileged women, when they support systemic/structural inequity/oppression.
				- By failing to show grace and compassion to those with difficult and challenging choices, we cannot compare them to those with the highly privileged.
				- Poorer women/people have to struggle with the short-term painful impact of hunger as well as avoid horrific long-term and multi-generational challenges of food insecurity.
				- Inclusive and intersectional feminism have to address solutions to help poorer women, and other people, mitigate systemic/structural inequity/oppression and address their (basic) needs.
				- More privileged women need to do their part in shaping public policy and institutional policy to mitigate systemic/structural inequity/oppression and address the (basic) needs of poorer women, and other poorer people.
					* The more power you have, the more you need to use that power to help others.
	- Second paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* For increasing race-based income inequity and wealth inequity, poorer women of color face more challenges to overcome challenges of food insecurity that can get progressively worse from hunger to increasingly worse malnutrition.
			+ Without women with more socioeconomic power and privileged feminist allies advocating for them, and helping them to "shap[e] public policy and institutional policy to mitigate systemic/structural inequity/oppression and address the (basic) needs of poorer women, and other poorer people" (quoted from my notes for the previous paragraph)
		* Refrain of "the more power you have, the more you need to use that power to help others" (quoted from my notes for the previous paragraph)
+ pp. 42
	- First paragraph.
		* Politicians and policymakers prefer to mitigate community health, and public health, problems such as obesity, rather than "mitigate systemic/structural inequity/oppression and address the (basic) needs of poorer women, and other poorer people" (quoted from my notes for the previous paragraph).
			* Without addressing ***food desert and transit/transportation desert***, politicians and policymakers would help people in positions of socioeconomic and polical power to maintain or exacerbate systemic/structural inequity/oppression.
			* In a food desert, it is cheaper for people to access soda (due to tax subsidies??? - ***CITE THIS!!!***) than products of water or fruit juice. Hence, to satisfy the immediate need of thirst, they would consume soda that would subsequently contribute to (more) health problems.
	- Second paragraph.
		* Advocates (politicians and policymakers) for taxes on soda to address problems associated with obesity fail to acknowledge publications that the amount of sugar consumed does not lead to specific health outcomes that this tax policy is designed to address.
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* By weaponizing fatphobia and obesity as well as designing, advocating for, and implementing tax policy on soda, politicians and policymakers avoid discussions and challenges from community members to address ***food desert and transit/transportation desert***, environmental inequity, and other aspects of systemic/structural inequity/oppression, that harm their constituents.
			+ By failing to provide green spaces and other outdoor spaces to allow people to exercise and breathe in clean air, constituents cannot do these to improve their overall health.
			+ Likewise, constituents need to have access to:
				- affordable fresh produce
				- clean water
				- access to health care
				- culturally sensitive crime mitigation programs, to avoid racist policing
			+ Mitigation programs, as part of public/social services, for at-risk youth to promote patterns of healthy behavior can include:
				- midnight basketball
				- after-school, weekend, and summer programs
			+ Mitigation programs can provide food and nutrition classes.
			+ As written in my notes for pp. 39, first paragraph, ***liberatrian racism*** keeps politicians and policymakers from funding these programs in the U.S. (and elsewhere - ***CITATION NEEDED***)
+ pp. 43
	- First paragraph.
		* As written in my notes for pp. 40, third paragraph, pp. 42, first to third paragraphs, the disingenuity leads politicians and policymakers to use taxes collected from the tax policy for soda to fund programs that address their interests, which do not include resolving problems associated with food insecurity such as ***food desert and transit/transportation desert***.
		+ It highlights tax policy on soda as a regressive tax policy.
