##	Introduction


+ pp. 10
	- First paragraph resonates with me. It starts with "There's probably some value in being seen as a good girl" and ends with "My feminism doesn't center on those who are comfortable with the status quo because ultimately that road can never lead to equity for girls like me."
		* It addresses using moral suasion to keep girls and women of color "in their place." 
	- Second paragraph.
		* Tone policing, coupled with moral suasion, affects the mental health of the more marginalized (and/or less privileged), which consequently affects physical health of these people groups.
		* Tone policing and moral suasion are also weaponized to make it very hard for the more marginalized and/or less privileged to engage in self advocacy, protect themselves from harassment and discrimination, and exercise their right to be subjected to due process.
	- Third paragraph.
		* Challenging to walk the fine line between self- advocacy/protection and acting out due to increasing frustration of being subjected to much higher standards of ethical conduct and greater frequency of being screened for compliance to such hypocritical standards of conduct.
+ pp. 11
	- First paragraph.
		* I love the last sentence.
			+ "Feminism is the work that you do, and the people you do it for who matter more than anything else."
		* The second-last sentence is also important.
			+ "It isn't a matter of saying the right words at the right time."
	- Second paragraph.
		* This is critical, since it addresses the need for a multi-prong approach at different levels of abstract.
	- Third paragraph.
		* ***Absurd dismissal and invalidation of feelings, expressions, and statements from women of color***, including the racist assertation that these women cannot comprehend certain complex terms in feminism or feminist theory, or the English language, such as microaggressions or sentient.
		* ***This supports the need for inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism.***
+ pp. 12
	- Second paragraph.
		* Unfair expectations of women of color, due to tone policing and moral suasion.
			+ These expectations stresses these women out emotionally and physically.
			+ It makes it hard for these women to get adequate rest, help, support, and get their tasks done (due to the exploitation of their time, compassion, generosity, finances, and effort). Consequently, it builds up pressure in these women that makes them vulnerable to mental health challenges, physical health problems, further exploitation, and increases their desire to abandon increasingly impossible-to-fulfill responsibilities..
	- Third paragraph.
		* Problems of weaponizing tone policing to cover up their racism, and mitigate effort to address inclusive feminism, intersectional feminism, inclusive diversity, equity, and belonging. It stresses out the more marginalized and/or less privileged women.
+ pp. 13
	- First paragraph.
		* We need to be able to differentiate different types of discomfort, including good types of discomfort.
		* examples of good discomfort:
			+ craving for super-sweet, high-calorie drinks and dessert/food, while cutting intake of such drinks and dessert/food.
			+ learning a new language
			+ being disciplined to learn better conduct, procedures, and execution of processes/methodologies.
			+ while/when exercising
			+ guilt that leads to repentance
			+ learning about about our bias, willful ignorance, discriminatory behavior (conscious or subconscious), and microagressions that affect out ability to build up communities that value inclusive diversity, equity, and belonging
		* examples of bad discomfort:
			+ shame or guilt that leads to defensive justification of sexism, racism, and/or ableism
			+ guilt of giving up good dietary practices to binge eat on unhealthy food, such as super-sweet, high-calorie drinks and dessert/food
			+ physical discomfort that leads to giving up good habits of exercise and physical training
		* Ignoring and invalidating the hurt of marginalized and less privileged people, and suppressing research/studies on the impact of bias and discrimination on these marginalized and less privileged people, while ignoring facts, logical reasoning, and valid data, would make it more difficult to rally feminists behind advocating and sponsoring such women.
+ pp. 14
	- First paragraph.
		* Need to address financial and educational elitism, ableism, and anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiments among more privileged and less marginalized women.
+ pp. 15
	- ***The book is about inclusive and intersectional feminism.***
