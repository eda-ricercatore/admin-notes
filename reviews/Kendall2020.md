##	Introduction


pp. ix-xviii  (official, from the paper version)
+ pp. 10
	- First paragraph resonates with me. It starts with "There's probably some value in being seen as a good girl" and ends with "My feminism doesn't center on those who are comfortable with the status quo because ultimately that road can never lead to equity for girls like me."
		* It addresses using moral suasion to keep girls and women of color "in their place." 
		* (pp. xi, second/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Second paragraph.
		* Tone policing, coupled with moral suasion, affects the mental health of the more marginalized (and/or less privileged), which consequently affects physical health of these people groups.
		* Tone policing and moral suasion are also weaponized to make it very hard for the more marginalized and/or less privileged to engage in self advocacy, protect themselves from harassment and discrimination, and exercise their right to be subjected to due process.
		* (pp. xii, first paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* Challenging to walk the fine line between self- advocacy/protection and acting out due to increasing frustration of being subjected to much higher standards of ethical conduct and greater frequency of being screened for compliance to such hypocritical standards of conduct.
		* (pp. xii, second/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 11
	- First paragraph.
		* I love the last sentence.
			+ "Feminism is the work that you do, and the people you do it for who matter more than anything else."
		* The second-last sentence is also important.
			+ "It isn't a matter of saying the right words at the right time."
		* (pp. xiii, first paragraph that started on the previous page)
	- Second paragraph.
		* This is critical, since it addresses the need for a multi-prong approach at different levels of abstract.
		* (pp. 2, second paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* ***Absurd dismissal and invalidation of feelings, expressions, and statements from women of color***, including the racist assertation that these women cannot comprehend certain complex terms in feminism or feminist theory, or the English language, such as microaggressions or sentient.
		* ***This supports the need for inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism.***
			+ inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism would include:
				- postcolonial feminism
				- Black feminism
				- African feminism
				- triple oppression
					* or, double jeopardy
					* or, Jane Crow
					* or, triple exploitation
					* challenges ***kyriarchy***
		* (pp. xiii, second/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 12
	- Second paragraph.
		* Unfair expectations of women of color, due to tone policing and moral suasion.
			+ These expectations stresses these women out emotionally and physically.
			+ It makes it hard for these women to get adequate rest, help, support, and get their tasks done (due to the exploitation of their time, compassion, generosity, finances, and effort). Consequently, it builds up pressure in these women that makes them vulnerable to mental health challenges, physical health problems, further exploitation, and increases their desire to abandon increasingly impossible-to-fulfill responsibilities..
		* (pp. xiv, third/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Third paragraph.
		* Problems of weaponizing tone policing to cover up their racism, and mitigate effort to address inclusive feminism, intersectional feminism, inclusive diversity, equity, and belonging. It stresses out the more marginalized and/or less privileged women.
		* (pp. xv, second paragraph)
+ pp. 13
	- First paragraph.
		* We need to be able to differentiate different types of discomfort, including good types of discomfort.
		* examples of good discomfort:
			+ craving for super-sweet, high-calorie drinks and dessert/food, while cutting intake of such drinks and dessert/food.
			+ learning a new language
			+ being disciplined to learn better conduct, procedures, and execution of processes/methodologies.
			+ while/when exercising
			+ guilt that leads to repentance
			+ learning about about our bias, willful ignorance, discriminatory behavior (conscious or subconscious), and microagressions that affect out ability to build up communities that value inclusive diversity, equity, and belonging
		* examples of bad discomfort:
			+ shame or guilt that leads to defensive justification of sexism, racism, and/or ableism
			+ guilt of giving up good dietary practices to binge eat on unhealthy food, such as super-sweet, high-calorie drinks and dessert/food
			+ physical discomfort that leads to giving up good habits of exercise and physical training
		* Ignoring and invalidating the hurt of marginalized and less privileged people, and suppressing research/studies on the impact of bias and discrimination on these marginalized and less privileged people, while ignoring facts, logical reasoning, and valid data, would make it more difficult to rally feminists behind advocating and sponsoring such women.
		* (pp. xvii, third/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 14
	- First paragraph.
		* Need to address financial and educational elitism, (ableism, and anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiments) among more privileged and less marginalized women.
		* (pp. xvii, first paragraph)
+ pp. 15
	- ***The book is about inclusive and intersectional feminism.***
	* (pp. xviii, third/last paragraph)







##	Solidarity is Still for White Women



pp. 1-14 (official, from the paper version)
+ pp. 16
	- First paragraph.
		* Feminism cannot be limited to address the needs and interests of middle-class and upper-class White women in the United States, and countries with a lot of people of European descent (such as Canada, European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa).
			+ reproductive needs
		* It has to address the problems that other women of less privilege, or more marginalized women, such as the following.
			+ food insecurity
			+ education
			+ health care
		* Need for ***inclusive and intersectional feminism***.
		* (pp. 1, first paragraph)
	- Second paragraph.
		* White feminism centers the interests of middle-class and upper-class White women at the expense of other women, from women of color to lower-income women and disabled women
		* White feminism is cast as mainstream feminism
			+ "mainstream White feminism" prioritizes achieving socioeconomic equity for (able-bodied, cisgendered, heterosexual), middle-class and upper-class White women before other women, even when other women have less privilege and are more marginalized
		* (able-bodied, cisgendered, heterosexual), middle-class and upper-class White women responded to calls for inclusive and intersectional feminism by asserting that such inclusive feminists are divisive and such calls lead to infighting, as opposed to acknowledging and mitigating/addressing the problems of racism, ableism, anti-LGBTQIA+ bias and discrimination, and socioeconomic class discrimination (or financial/academic elitism).
			+ attacks on inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism are also used to attack the following:
				- postcolonial feminism
		* (pp. 1, second/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 17
	- Second paragraph.
		* Highlights some problems that women of color and LGBTQIA+ women (specifically trans women) face.
		* (pp. 2, second paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Third paragraph.
		* To address the problems of non-inclusive, or exclusive, feminism, we need to change/evolve our priorities to address more pressing needs with greater priority.
		* address the following needs with more priority and importance:
			+ housing
			+ food
			+ clothing
			+ public transportation
			+ public education
			+ income equity
		* to strive for income equity, and wealth equity, we need to improve education to help women get better jobs for high-skilled professionals
			+ the argument assumes that the number and quality of job opportunities is proportional to the level of selected professional education (degrees for medicine, law, engineering) and/or research skills (e.g., in computer science, engineering, biochemistry, and biotechnology)
		* (pp. 3, second paragraph)
+ pp. 18
	- First paragraph.
		* address the need to pivot to ***inclusive and intersectional feminism*** by:
			+ addressing respectability politics that is used to value/prioritize White feminism over inclusive/intersectional feminism, and consequently indicate that a subset of women deserve respect and protection
				- people from marginalized people groups, or less privileged people, "internally police members" of their community to pressure them to align with the norms of the dominant culture
				- respectability politics keeps us from addressing the needs of the following groups of women:
					* sex workers
					* incarcerated women, and formerly incarcerated women
					* women who had to face (multiple) hard life choices
				- White feminism, or mainstream feminism, uses paths/options dictated by White men, rather tha address the needs of all women groups, including the more marginalized and less privileged
					* all women desrves help, regardless if they are employed, part-time or full-time
						* stay-at-home parents deserve help, just like workers/professionals
		* (pp. 3, third/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Second paragraph:
		* Not all women-identifying people have the same set of challenges, including challenges in the context of reproductive health
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, focuses on cisgender able-bodied White women in the developed world
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, excludes:
				- trans-women
				- intersex people, and other people with bodies that don't fit the biological classification of male or women based on their genitalia
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, fails to address:
				- employment equity statistics
					* income equity
						* White American women make less than White American men
						* American women of color make less than White American women
				- other socioeconomic equity statistics
					* wealth equity
				- complaints about affirmative action policies:
					* including complaints by White American women about how people of color benefit from these policies far more than others, even though White American women benefit from affirmative action policies far more than others
				- failure to use their privilege as the most privileged people group (cisgender able-bodied White American women), among oppressed people groups, to advocate for and sponsor people of color, ... disabled people
		* (pp. 4, second paragraph)
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page:
		* White American women use racist myth of "Black American women being stronger" to justify prioritizing themselves (i.e., White American women) over women of color (in the U.S. and elsewhere)
			+ Such White American women claim that they need feminist support more than women of color (in the U.S. and elsewhere), since women of color "can handle" more "abuse and ignorance", and have less urgent care and concern
		* (pp. 4, third/last paragraph that ends on the next page)
+ pp. 19
	- First paragraph.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women are trained/taught to center feminism on themselves
			+ These are well documented in mass media.
		* (pp. 5, first paragraph)
	- Second paragraph.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women are trained/taught to center attention on themselves
				- This is an unspoken assumption.
				- People of color need to give them attention, whenever they want the attention, and to be absent from the lives of White American women when they want the absence
				- White American women need to learn to listen to:
					* people of color, in general
					* women of color, particularly Black American women
					* men of color, who they have the power to oppress
				- White American women, or White Americans in general, do not want to acknowledge the racist history of:
					* men of color, not just Black American men, are being demonized or killed for expressing romantic/sexual interest in White women
					* tears of White (American) women can adversely affect the careers and lives of men/people of color, particularly Black American men
		* (pp. 5, second paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Third paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women, or White Americans in general, do not want to acknowledge the racist history of:
				- men of color, not just Black American men, are being demonized or killed for expressing romantic/sexual interest in White women
				- asserting all women should unite and support each other, without supporting inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism, and without seeking equity by giving less privileged and more marginalized women more priority
		* (pp. 6, second paragraph)
+ pp. 20
	- Second paragraph.
		* inclusive feminism and intersectional feminism differ from White feminism, or mainstream feminism, since they:
			+ are anti-racist
			+ good/neutral intentions by White people/Americans are worthless when compared to the considerable adversarial impact (of their speech and/or actions) on people/women of color
				- such considerable adversarial impact are not experienced by White people/Americans/women
		* (pp. 6, third paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women need to learn that:
				- sisterhood or solidarity cannot function as one sided
				- they have to be humble enough to accept critical feedback, critique, and be told that they are wrong when they are wrong
				- not all critiques are unjustified attacks
				- they should not center themselves at the center of the struggles of women of color, and other marginalized women groups (e.g., disabled women)
		* (pp. 6, fourth paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Fourth paragraph that ends on the next page.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ White American women need to learn that:
				- White feminist, or mainstream feminist, rhetoric is rooted in the following biases:
					* racism
					* ableism
					* transmisogyny
					* anti-Semitism
					* Islamophobia
				- the aforementioned biases marginalize women who are not cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women
				- people's identities do intersect
					* e.g., disabled, immigrant women of color
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, hurts marginalized women
			+ White feminism, or mainstream feminism, makes it very challenging for marginalized women to support sisterhood or solidarity (with White American women)
		* (pp. 7, second paragraph)
+ pp. 21
	- First paragraph.
		* problems of White feminism, or mainstream feminism:
			+ need to shift from pitying and empathizing into ***scalable compassion***
			+ address systemic/structural inequity:
				- for access to affordable, high-quality K-12 schools and colleges/universities
				- for access to opportunities for personal and professional development, protection, advocacy, sponsorship
			+ go beyond merely studying systemic/structural inequity to create and effectively implement policies to mitigate such inequity
			+ stop weaponizing tone policing, moral suasion, and respectability politics to keep feminism from being inclusive and intersectional
				- respectability politics won't save women from sexism and misogyny, and women of color from racism by White (American) women
			+ when White (American) women fail to address their harmful behavior (such as racism, anti-immigrant bias, and ableism), they make it hard for marginalized women to enthusiastically collaborate with highly-privileged, cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied White American women
				- "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" is not necessarily true
				- "the enemy of my enemy may be my enemy as well"
				- caught in these spats between groups of women mean that sexist and misogynistic men can use "divide and conquer" to keep women from uniting against ***kyriarchy***
		* (pp. 7, third paragraph that ends on the next page)
	- Second paragraph.
		* feminists of all identities have to address would-be allies in what they seek in inclusive and intersectional feminism
		* allies, from people who are not cisgender women to White (American) women, have to learn to listen and respect people who we choose to help
		* more privileged feminist cannot embrace or propagate savior myths
		* solidarity cannot include:
			+ people who disagree with common goals
			+ people who cannot work in partnership with inclusive and intersectional feminists
		* equal partners in inclusive and intersectional feminism:
			+ can negotiate
			+ can compromise
			+ can build genuine friendship
				- this takes:
					* time
					* effort
					* willingness to accept that some places are not for you/me
		* (pp. 8, second paragraph)
	- Third paragraph.
		* "\#solidarityisforwhitewomen" is a hashtag that addresses the need for inclusive and intersectional feminism:
			+ "It is a rhetorical shorthand for the reality that:"
				-
