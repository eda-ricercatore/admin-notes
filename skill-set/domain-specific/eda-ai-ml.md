###	Energy-Efficent EDA, or Low-Power EDA



circuit-level power optimization: 
+ transistor sizing
+ voltage scaling
+ voltage islands
+ variable VDD
+ multiple threshold voltages
	- Modern processes can build transistors with different thresholds. Power can be saved by using a mixture of CMOS transistors with two or more different threshold voltages. In the simplest form there are two different thresholds available, common called High-Vt and Low-Vt, where Vt stands for threshold voltage. ***High threshold transistors are slower but leak less, and can be used in non-critical circuits.***
+ power gating
	- This technique uses high Vt sleep transistors which cut-off a circuit block when the block is not switching. The sleep transistor sizing is an important design parameter. This technique, also known as MTCMOS, or Multi-Threshold CMOS reduces stand-by or leakage power, and also enables Iddq testing.
+ long-channel transistors
	- Transistors of more than minimum length leak less, but are bigger and slower.
+ stacking and parking states
	- Logic gates may leak differently during logically equivalent input states (say 10 on a NAND gate, as opposed to 01). State machines may have less leakage in certain states.
+ logic styles:
	- dynamic and static logic





logic synthesis for low power
+ clock gating

+ path balancing

+ finite-state machine decomposition
+ retiming
+ as part of FPGA logic synthesis

###	MLOps, or ML Ops, ModelOps, & AIOps 





####	MLOps, or ML Ops



MLOps is the set of practices at the intersection of Machine Learning, DevOps and Data Engineering.

MLOps or ML Ops is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.

Machine learning models are tested and developed in isolated experimental systems. When an algorithm is ready to be launched, MLOps is practiced between Data Scientists, DevOps, and Machine Learning engineers to transition the algorithm to production systems.

Similar to DevOps or DataOps approaches, MLOps seeks to increase automation and improve the quality of production models, while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements. While MLOps started as a set of best practices, it is slowly evolving into an independent approach to ML lifecycle management.

MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle:
+ integrating with model generation
	- software development lifecycle
	- continuous integration/continuous delivery, CI/CD
+ orchestration
+ deployment
+ health
+ diagnostics
+ governance
+ business metrics

MLOps is a subset of ModelOps
+ MLOps is focused on the operationalization of ML models, while ModelOps covers the operationalization of all types of AI models.
+ MLOps is the intersection of:
	- machine learning engineering
	- DevOps
	- data engineering



Steps in a machine learning lifecycle:
+ data collection
+ data processing
+ feature engineering
+ data labelling
+ model design
+ model training
+ optimization
+ endpoint deployment
+ endpoint monitoring




Goals of enterprise machine learning that can be achieved through MLOps systems:
+ Deployment and automation
+ Reproducibility of models and predictions
+ Diagnostics
+ Governance and regulatory compliance
+ Scalability
+ Collaboration
+ Business uses
+ Monitoring and management


A common architecture of an MLOps system would include data science platforms where models are constructed and the analytical engines where computations are performed, with the MLOps tool orchestrating the movement of machine learning models, data and outcomes between the systems.

Notes:
+ In database normalization, unnormalized form (UNF), also known as an unnormalized relation or non first normal form (N1NF or NF^2),[1] is a database data model (organization of data in a database) which does not meet any of the conditions of database normalization defined by the relational model. Database systems which support unnormalized data are sometimes called non-relational or NoSQL databases. In the relational model, unnormalized relations can be considered the starting point for a process of normalization. It should not be confused with denormalization, where normalization is deliberately compromised for selected tables in a relational database.

###	DataOps



DataOps is a set of practices, processes and technologies that combines an integrated and process-oriented perspective on data with automation and methods from agile software engineering to improve quality, speed, and collaboration and promote a culture of continuous improvement in the area of data analytics.

DataOps incorporates the Agile methodology to shorten the cycle time of analytics development in alignment with business goals.

DevOps focuses on continuous delivery by leveraging on-demand IT resources and by automating test and deployment of software. This merging of software development and IT operations has improved velocity, quality, predictability and scale of software engineering and deployment. Borrowing methods from DevOps, DataOps seeks to bring these same improvements to data analytics.

DataOps utilizes statistical process control (SPC) to monitor and control the data analytics pipeline. With SPC in place, the data flowing through an operational system is constantly monitored and verified to be working. If an anomaly occurs, the data analytics team can be notified through an automated alert.

DataOps is not tied to a particular technology, architecture, tool, language or framework.

Tools that support DataOps promote:
+ collaboration
+ orchestration
+ quality
+ security
+ access
+ ease of use



The volume of data is forecast to grow at a rate of 32% CAGR to 180 Zettabytes by the year 2025. 

DataOps seeks to provide the ***tools, processes, and organizational structures*** to cope with this significant increase in data. ***Automation streamlines the daily demands of managing large integrated databases,*** freeing the data team to develop new analytics in a more efficient and effective way. ***DataOps seeks to increase velocity, reliability, and quality of data analytics. It emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration, automation, measurement and cooperation between data scientists, analysts, data/ETL (extract, transform, load) engineers, information technology (IT), and quality assurance/governance.***




DataOps leadership principles:
+ Establish progress and performance measurements at every stage of the data flow. Where possible, benchmark data-flow cycle times.
+ Define rules for an abstracted semantic layer. Ensure everyone is "speaking the same language" and agrees upon what the data (and metadata) is and is not.
+ Validate with the "eyeball test":
	- Include continuous-improvement -oriented human feedback loops.
	- Consumers must be able to trust the data, and that can only come with incremental validation.
+ Automate as many stages of the data flow as possible, including:
	- BI
	- data science
	- data analytics
+ Using benchmarked performance information, identify bottlenecks and then optimize for them. This may require investment in commodity hardware, or automation of a formerly-human-delivered data-science step in the process.
+ Establish governance discipline, with a particular focus on two-way data control, data ownership, transparency, and comprehensive data lineage tracking through the entire workflow.
+ ***Design process for growth and extensibility. The data flow model must be designed to accommodate volume and variety of data.*** Ensure enabling technologies are priced affordably to scale with that enterprise data growth.”

###	Machine Learning Research with Alibaba Group

+ Building an innovative and systematic AI benchmarks platform
	- Currently in Alibaba Group, deep learning and related applications have been employed in various business departments. Tmall, Alitrip, Taobao, Ant Financial and other departments are making extensive use of emerging deep learning technologies to continuously improve application and algorithms and enhance the consumer experience. On the one hand, Alibaba's engineering teams design, experiment and deploy different deep learning algorithms and applications every day. On the other hand, deep learning requires a lot of computational power, which also puts higher requirements on the computational power of the hardware and their adaptability to the application. How to balance the demand and supply relationship between these two and integrate the solution into a systematic platform product? How to automatically and systematically evaluate the computional power of an AI hardware? How to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a hardware for usage in an application and give customer recommendations through a systematic platform? These are the challenges we are currently dealing with and we need to solve. Recently we have launched the AI Matrix product (through aimatrix.ai website), but it is still in the early stage of the product. In the future, we need more people who have the same understanding as us and are willing to involve in solving these problems. Let's contribute our own strength and make the AI Matrix as an effective systematic platform and an impactful technical brand.

###	Quantum Computing Research with Alibaba Group

+ Quantum Algorithm for Near-term Quantum Devices
	- A general-purpose fault-tolerant quantum computer will require millions of physical qubits and millions of quantum gate operations. With quantum computers of significant size now on the horizon, we should understand how to best exploit the initially limited abilities and how to develop and run useful quantum algorithms within the limited circuit depth of intermediate size quantum devices with limited error correction.
+ Research in Practical Applications of Quantum-Safe Communication
	- Quantum communication may refer to quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and quantum entanglement. Among those, quantum key distribution (QKD) is one of the most practical applications in recent years. Quantum cryptography takes the advantage of the laws of quantum physics to protect data,
	- Currently, the most significant problems in practical quantum cryptography systems include: high-speed quantum random number generation, long-distance fiber quantum key distribution with high key generation speed, co-fiber transmission of classical and quantum optical signals, as well as practical commercialization and stabilization.
	- Our project aims to study these critical issues in quantum cryptography system for practical applications. Due to the transmission loss and dark count, the bottleneck for its practical application lies in the trade-off between high speed key generation rate and long transmission distance. In order to solve these problems, one potential solution is to design more efficient telecommunication protocol to exceed the theoretical up bound of the generation rate. Meanwhile, the project will also focus on the study and practical solutions for quantum random number generation, post-quantum cryptography algorithm, the migration of classical and quantum networks, etc
