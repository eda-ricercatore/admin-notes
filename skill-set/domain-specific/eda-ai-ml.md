###	Machine Learning Research with Alibaba Group

+ Building an innovative and systematic AI benchmarks platform
	- Currently in Alibaba Group, deep learning and related applications have been employed in various business departments. Tmall, Alitrip, Taobao, Ant Financial and other departments are making extensive use of emerging deep learning technologies to continuously improve application and algorithms and enhance the consumer experience. On the one hand, Alibaba's engineering teams design, experiment and deploy different deep learning algorithms and applications every day. On the other hand, deep learning requires a lot of computational power, which also puts higher requirements on the computational power of the hardware and their adaptability to the application. How to balance the demand and supply relationship between these two and integrate the solution into a systematic platform product? How to automatically and systematically evaluate the computional power of an AI hardware? How to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a hardware for usage in an application and give customer recommendations through a systematic platform? These are the challenges we are currently dealing with and we need to solve. Recently we have launched the AI Matrix product (through aimatrix.ai website), but it is still in the early stage of the product. In the future, we need more people who have the same understanding as us and are willing to involve in solving these problems. Let's contribute our own strength and make the AI Matrix as an effective systematic platform and an impactful technical brand.

###	Quantum Computing Research with Alibaba Group

+ Quantum Algorithm for Near-term Quantum Devices
	- A general-purpose fault-tolerant quantum computer will require millions of physical qubits and millions of quantum gate operations. With quantum computers of significant size now on the horizon, we should understand how to best exploit the initially limited abilities and how to develop and run useful quantum algorithms within the limited circuit depth of intermediate size quantum devices with limited error correction.
+ Research in Practical Applications of Quantum-Safe Communication
	- Quantum communication may refer to quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and quantum entanglement. Among those, quantum key distribution (QKD) is one of the most practical applications in recent years. Quantum cryptography takes the advantage of the laws of quantum physics to protect data,
	- Currently, the most significant problems in practical quantum cryptography systems include: high-speed quantum random number generation, long-distance fiber quantum key distribution with high key generation speed, co-fiber transmission of classical and quantum optical signals, as well as practical commercialization and stabilization.
	- Our project aims to study these critical issues in quantum cryptography system for practical applications. Due to the transmission loss and dark count, the bottleneck for its practical application lies in the trade-off between high speed key generation rate and long transmission distance. In order to solve these problems, one potential solution is to design more efficient telecommunication protocol to exceed the theoretical up bound of the generation rate. Meanwhile, the project will also focus on the study and practical solutions for quantum random number generation, post-quantum cryptography algorithm, the migration of classical and quantum networks, etc
