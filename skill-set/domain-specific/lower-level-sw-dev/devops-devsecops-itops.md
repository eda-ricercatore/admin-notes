##	DevSecOps




DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. Contrary to a traditional centralized security team model, each delivery team is empowered to factor in the correct security controls into their software delivery. Security practices and testing are performed earlier in the development lifecycle, hence the term "shift left" can be used. Security is tested in three main areas: static, software composition, and dynamic.

IT operations analytics (ITOA) is an approach or method to retrieve, analyze, and report data for IT operations.
+ Or, known as:
	- advanced operational analytics
	- IT data analytics
+ ITOA may apply big data analytics to large datasets to produce business insights.
+ ***ITOA is different than AIOps, which focuses on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the applications of ITOA.***
+ The use of mathematical algorithms and other innovations to extract meaningful information from the sea of raw data collected by management and monitoring technologies.



Context:
+ (IT) systems management
	- Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security (FCAPS)
	- Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)





applications of ITOA systems:
+ Root cause analysis:
	- The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored can help users pinpoint fine-grained and previously unknown root causes of overall system behavior pathologies.
+ Proactive control of service performance and availability:
	- Predicts future system states and the impact of those states on performance.
+ Problem assignment:
	- Determines how problems may be resolved or, at least, direct the results of inferences to the most appropriate individuals or communities in the enterprise for problem resolution.
+ Service impact analysis:
	- When multiple root causes are known, the analytics system's output is used to determine and rank the relative impact, so that resources can be devoted to correcting the fault in the most timely and cost-effective way possible.
+ Complement best-of-breed technology:
	- The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored are used to correct or extend the outputs of other discovery-oriented tools to improve the fidelity of information used in operational tasks (e.g., service dependency maps, application runtime architecture topologies, network topologies).
+ Real time application behavior learning:
	- Learns & correlates the behavior of Application based on user pattern and underlying Infrastructure on various application patterns, create metrics of such correlated patterns and store it for further analysis.
+ Dynamically baselines threshold:
	- Learns behavior of Infrastructure on various application user patterns and determines the Optimal behavior of the Infra and technological components, bench marks and baselines the low and high water mark for the specific environments and dynamically changes the bench mark baselines with the changing infra and user patterns without any manual intervention

##	 Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations, AIOps



Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is an industry category for machine learning analytics technology that enhances IT operations analytics.


Goals of AIOps:
+ enable IT transformation
+ receive continuous insights that provide continuous fixes and improvements via automation



AIOps can be viewed as CI/CD for core IT functions.
+ Given the inherent nature of IT operations, which is closely tied to cloud deployment and the management of distributed applications, AIOps has increasingly led to the coalescence of machine learning and cloud research.



main aspects of an AIOps platform:
+ machine learning
+ big data

In order to collect observational data and engagement data that can be found inside a big data platform, which requires a shift away from sectionally segregated IT data, a holistic machine learning and analytics strategy is implemented with the combined IT data.





AIOps tasks include:
+ automation
+ performance monitoring
+ event correlations



AIOps process:
+ The *normalized data* is suitable to be processed through machine learning algorithms to *automatically reduce noise* and *identify the probable root cause of incidents*.
	- The main output of such stage is the ***detection of any abnormal behavior from users, devices or applications***.
+ Noise reduction can be done by various methods, but most of the research in the field points to the following actions:
	- Analysis of all incoming alerts;
	- Remove duplicates;
	- Identify the false positives;
	- Early *anomaly, fault and failure* (AFF) detection and analysis.[13]
+ ***Anomaly detection*** - another step in any AIOps process is based on the analysis of past behavior of users, equipment and applications. Anything that strays from that behavior baseline is considered unusual and flagged as abnormal.
+ ***Root cause determination*** is usually done by passing incoming alerts through algorithms that take into consideration correlated events as well as topology dependencies. The algorithms on which AI are basing their functioning can be influenced directly, essentially by "training" them.





AIOps platforms enabling IT operations management (ITOM)
+ inputs:
	- historic data
	- real-time streaming data
	- vendor-agnostic data ingestion
+ input types:
	- logs
	- metrics
	- wire data
	- document text
+ observe (monitoring)
+ act (IT Service Management process, ITSM)
+ engage (monitoring)
+ machine learning with *Big Data*
+ outputs:
	- historical analysis
	- anomaly detection
	- performance analysis
	- correlation and contextualization


Factors of IT maturity:
+ organizational structures
+ processes and practices
+ skills and knowledge,
+ tools and policies
+ systems and data
+ documents and agreements



cause-and-effect sequence
+ outcomes
+ capabilities
+ IT maturity
+ IT excellence
+ business maturity, innovation, and productivity




Role of IT suppert services:
+ aware
	- The organization is aware of its chaotic stage and needs.
	- IT capabilities are unstable and success depends on the individuals' effort and technical knowledge.
+ committed
	- IT operations are more process-oriented, thus more reputable.
	- Success depends on process adherence and point collaboration.
	- This level is a stable plateau where IT can "keep the lights on."
+ proactive
	- IT organization is recognized as "mature."
	- At this level, IT has reached a tipping point from which a path to high IT maturity is accessible.
+ aligned
	- IT is a highly efficient internal service provider, offering a stable portfolio of optimized services.
+ business partner
	- IT is a trusted partner and innovator for the business

##	CloudOps



CloudOps include:
+ cloud-specific flexible provisioning and scalability of environments,
+ built-in task automation.













##	NoOps



NoOps (or) No Operation is the new idea that completely automates a software environment from the underlying system infrastructure through technologies including machine learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a result, there is no need for any operation team to manage software in-house.

With NoOps, developers can concentrate solely on writing and improving the software product’s code that improves the resources like management, security, infrastructure, product, and operations part of the lifecycle. Additionally, the service providers offer developers to develop software like resources, backups, patches, and the right cloud infrastructure to work independently without any interference.

***Serverless architecture*** is the best example for NoOps software. The developer’s team aims to create their application and deploy them in ***serverless computing*** without interfering any operational or infrastructure considerations.

Operating the right tools in NoOps can achieve a faster deployment process than DevOps by running Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Function as a Service (FaaS) in the cloud. Moreover, NoOps can easily be adaptable for Product as a Service companies, small-scale applications, and start-ups.
