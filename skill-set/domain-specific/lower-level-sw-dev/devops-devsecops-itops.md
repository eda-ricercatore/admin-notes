##	DevOps




A DevOps toolchain is a set or combination of tools that aid in the delivery, development, and management of software applications throughout the systems development life cycle, as coordinated by an organisation that uses DevOps practices.

Generally, DevOps tools fit into one or more activities, which supports specific DevOps initiatives: Plan, Create, Verify, Package, Release, Configure, Monitor, and Version Control.


DevOps include:
+ Microservices
+ DevOps automation
+ Automation with version control
	- Many organizations use version control to power DevOps automation technologies like virtual machines, containerization (or OS-level virtualization), and CI/CD. 




DevOps life cycle:
+ continuous development
+ continuous integration
+ continuous testing
+ continuous monitoring
+ continuous feedback
+ continuous deployment
+ continuous operations



Alternate DevOps life cycle, exploiting real-time communication:

##	DevSecOps




DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. Contrary to a traditional centralized security team model, each delivery team is empowered to factor in the correct security controls into their software delivery. Security practices and testing are performed earlier in the development lifecycle, hence the term "shift left" can be used. Security is tested in three main areas: static, software composition, and dynamic.

		* deployed
		* monitored
		* controlled
	- provide automated alerts regarding model performance and behavior
	- automated processes and approvals for:
		* deployment
		* testing
		* refresh
		* monitoring
	- real-time visibility to performance of deployed models
+ Information Technologies Operations (ITOps) is the process responsible for acquiring, designing, deploying, configuring, and maintaining the physical and virtual components that comprise your IT infrastructure
+ While ITOps takes a broad view of the entire technology landscape that your organization relies on to conduct its business mission, DevOps focuses on the task at hand.
	- DevOps teams don’t always have the visibility or awareness of the downstream implications on the enterprise stack.
	- And this is where can modern ITOps team can help.
+ ITOps (or) Tech Ops is the most traditional Ops that refers to managing all the physical and software components of an organization’s IT environment.
	- It is responsible for the smooth running of a business by handling applications, delivery, maintaining services, and the underlying technologies administrated by a company's IT members to its internal or external clients.
	- It includes:
		* maintaining networks
		* ensuring security
		* managing data center
		* system administrators
		* regulatory compliance
		* licensing
		* managing software
		* managing help desk
		* supports IT infrastructure and systems for daily business operations
	- IT department can effortlessly manage all the IT operations and make the job easier by using IT Operations.
		* It guides the business to be more secure, swift, and productive.
+ includes:
	- networking operations
	- deploying, maintaining, and configuring applications
	- overseeing both physical and virtual components of a company's IT environment
+ includes:
	- administration and maintenance,
	- network management,
	- systems management,
	- technical support (help desk)



ITOps processes consists of 5 main aspects/phase:
+ Run Solutions
	- The primary purpose of having ITOps teams is to run solutions such as data backups, configurations, handling servers, and restoring systems after an outage or update.
	- The aim is to optimize the performance and allocate the proper resource for the most effective delivery.
+ Infrastructure
	- Managing the IT infrastructure includes maintaining, provisioning, setting up, and updating all the software and hardware applications and cloud resources of the company's IT infrastructure.
	- These components include:
		* operating systems
		* hypervisors
		* network infrastructure
		* platforms
		* container environments
		* physical servers
		* application software
	- The maintaining oversight of IT infrastructure is made on-premises data center or in the cloud.
+ Network
	- Network management is responsible for managing all network functions for internal or external IT communications.
	- Network management is also involved in configuring and managing telecommunication lines.
	- In addition, it allows authorized customers to secure remote access to the company's network.
+ Security
	- Security management is an integral function of IT service management (ITSM).
		* It deals with:
			+ securing the hardware and software assets
			+ implementing security within development operations
			+ managing access control
			+ ensuring that security standards have reached across the IT environment of the organization
+ Problem Solving
	- Event management or incident management is also known as Problem-solving, it can be divided into 2 types – preventive measures and reactive measures.
		* Preventive Measures
			+ Preventive measures reduce the possibility of disasters and find the solution to anticipate and avoid any negative impacts on the IT environment.
		* Reactive Measures
			+ This concept refers to cyber-attacks, critical situations, and other issue when implementing disaster recovery plans and help desk management services.














ITOps addresses:
+ infrastructure capacity
+ infrastructure availability
+ infrastructure security


KPIs for ITOps are based on:
+ application performance
+ infrastructure availability
+ infrastructure security
+ infrastructure cost























##	 IT operations analytics, ITOA


IT operations analytics (ITOA) is an approach or method to retrieve, analyze, and report data for IT operations.
+ Or, known as:
	- advanced operational analytics
	- IT data analytics
+ ITOA may apply big data analytics to large datasets to produce business insights.
+ ***ITOA is different than AIOps, which focuses on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the applications of ITOA.***
+ The use of mathematical algorithms and other innovations to extract meaningful information from the sea of raw data collected by management and monitoring technologies.



Context:
+ (IT) systems management
	- Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security (FCAPS)
	- Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)





applications of ITOA systems:
+ Root cause analysis:
	- The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored can help users pinpoint fine-grained and previously unknown root causes of overall system behavior pathologies.
+ Proactive control of service performance and availability:
	- Predicts future system states and the impact of those states on performance.
+ Problem assignment:
	- Determines how problems may be resolved or, at least, direct the results of inferences to the most appropriate individuals or communities in the enterprise for problem resolution.
+ Service impact analysis:
	- When multiple root causes are known, the analytics system's output is used to determine and rank the relative impact, so that resources can be devoted to correcting the fault in the most timely and cost-effective way possible.
+ Complement best-of-breed technology:
	- The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored are used to correct or extend the outputs of other discovery-oriented tools to improve the fidelity of information used in operational tasks (e.g., service dependency maps, application runtime architecture topologies, network topologies).
+ Real time application behavior learning:
	- Learns & correlates the behavior of Application based on user pattern and underlying Infrastructure on various application patterns, create metrics of such correlated patterns and store it for further analysis.
+ Dynamically baselines threshold:
	- Learns behavior of Infrastructure on various application user patterns and determines the Optimal behavior of the Infra and technological components, bench marks and baselines the low and high water mark for the specific environments and dynamically changes the bench mark baselines with the changing infra and user patterns without any manual intervention




Types of ITOA:
+ Log analysis
+ Unstructured text indexing, search and inference (UTISI)
+ Topological analysis (TA)
+ Multidimensional database search and analysis (MDSA)
+ Complex operations event processing (COEP)
+ Statistical pattern discovery and recognition (SPDR)

##	 Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations, AIOps



Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is an industry category for machine learning analytics technology that enhances IT operations analytics.


Goals of AIOps:
+ enable IT transformation
+ receive continuous insights that provide continuous fixes and improvements via automation



AIOps can be viewed as CI/CD for core IT functions.
+ Given the inherent nature of IT operations, which is closely tied to cloud deployment and the management of distributed applications, AIOps has increasingly led to the coalescence of machine learning and cloud research.



main aspects of an AIOps platform:
+ machine learning
+ big data

In order to collect observational data and engagement data that can be found inside a big data platform, which requires a shift away from sectionally segregated IT data, a holistic machine learning and analytics strategy is implemented with the combined IT data.





AIOps tasks include:
+ automation
+ performance monitoring
+ event correlations



AIOps process:
+ The *normalized data* is suitable to be processed through machine learning algorithms to *automatically reduce noise* and *identify the probable root cause of incidents*.
	- The main output of such stage is the ***detection of any abnormal behavior from users, devices or applications***.
+ Noise reduction can be done by various methods, but most of the research in the field points to the following actions:
	- Analysis of all incoming alerts;
	- Remove duplicates;
	- Identify the false positives;
	- Early *anomaly, fault and failure* (AFF) detection and analysis.[13]
+ ***Anomaly detection*** - another step in any AIOps process is based on the analysis of past behavior of users, equipment and applications. Anything that strays from that behavior baseline is considered unusual and flagged as abnormal.
+ ***Root cause determination*** is usually done by passing incoming alerts through algorithms that take into consideration correlated events as well as topology dependencies. The algorithms on which AI are basing their functioning can be influenced directly, essentially by "training" them.


Applications of AIOps:
+ analysis of large and unconnected datasets, or large number of un-normalized databases
	- including aggregated data
+ Automation of tasks (DevOps)
+ Machine learning platforms
+ Augmented reality
+ Agent-based simulations
+ Internet of things (IoT)
+ AI Optimized Hardware
+ Natural language generation
+ Streaming data platforms
+ Conversational BI and analytics

##	CloudOps



CloudOps include:
+ cloud-specific flexible provisioning and scalability of environments,
+ built-in task automation.













##	NoOps



NoOps (or) No Operation is the new idea that completely automates a software environment from the underlying system infrastructure through technologies including machine learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As a result, there is no need for any operation team to manage software in-house.

With NoOps, developers can concentrate solely on writing and improving the software product’s code that improves the resources like management, security, infrastructure, product, and operations part of the lifecycle. Additionally, the service providers offer developers to develop software like resources, backups, patches, and the right cloud infrastructure to work independently without any interference.

***Serverless architecture*** is the best example for NoOps software. The developer’s team aims to create their application and deploy them in ***serverless computing*** without interfering any operational or infrastructure considerations.

Operating the right tools in NoOps can achieve a faster deployment process than DevOps by running Platform as a Service (PaaS) or Function as a Service (FaaS) in the cloud. Moreover, NoOps can easily be adaptable for Product as a Service companies, small-scale applications, and start-ups.
