#	DevOps & Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) & DevSecOps & ITOps & IT operations analytics & AIOps


##	DevOps




A DevOps toolchain is a set or combination of tools that aid in the delivery, development, and management of software applications throughout the systems development life cycle, as coordinated by an organisation that uses DevOps practices.

Generally, DevOps tools fit into one or more activities, which supports specific DevOps initiatives: Plan, Create, Verify, Package, Release, Configure, Monitor, and Version Control.


DevOps include:
+ Microservices
+ DevOps automation
+ Automation with version control
	- Many organizations use version control to power DevOps automation technologies like virtual machines, containerization (or OS-level virtualization), and CI/CD.

##	DevSecOps




DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. Contrary to a traditional centralized security team model, each delivery team is empowered to factor in the correct security controls into their software delivery. Security practices and testing are performed earlier in the development lifecycle, hence the term "shift left" can be used. Security is tested in three main areas: static, software composition, and dynamic.

##	ITOps





ITOps addresses:
+ infrastructure capacity
+ infrastructure availability
+ infrastructure security


KPIs for ITOps are based on:
+ application performance
+ infrastructure availability
+ infrastructure security
+ infrastructure cost



ITOps
+ maintain core infrastructure and associated services needed to support AI and machine learning models running in business applications
+ enterprise AI role:
	- provide highly available, secure infrastructure to operate performant models in enterprise application to scale, 24x7
	- deliver performance metrics for deployed models and applications
	- plan and execute infrastructure evolution to support AI technologies
+ for ModelOps
	- centralized catalog of all:
		* models
		* model runtime requirements
		* lineage
		* operational history
	- regardless of tools to create AI and ML models, support standardized models on any infrastructure (prem, cloud, or hybrid) that can be consistently:
		* deployed
		* monitored
		* controlled
	- provide automated alerts regarding model performance and behavior
	- automated processes and approvals for:
		* deployment
		* testing
		* refresh
		* monitoring
	- real-time visibility to performance of deployed models
+ Information Technologies Operations (ITOps) is the process responsible for acquiring, designing, deploying, configuring, and maintaining the physical and virtual components that comprise your IT infrastructure







##	 IT operations analytics, ITOA


IT operations analytics (ITOA) is an approach or method to retrieve, analyze, and report data for IT operations.
+ Or, known as:
	- advanced operational analytics
	- IT data analytics
+ ITOA may apply big data analytics to large datasets to produce business insights.
+ ***ITOA is different than AIOps, which focuses on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the applications of ITOA.***
+ The use of mathematical algorithms and other innovations to extract meaningful information from the sea of raw data collected by management and monitoring technologies.



Context:
+ (IT) systems management
	- Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security (FCAPS)
	- Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)





applications of ITOA systems:
+ Root cause analysis:
	- The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored can help users pinpoint fine-grained and previously unknown root causes of overall system behavior pathologies.
+ Proactive control of service performance and availability:
	- Predicts future system states and the impact of those states on performance.
+ Problem assignment:
	- Determines how problems may be resolved or, at least, direct the results of inferences to the most appropriate individuals or communities in the enterprise for problem resolution.
+ Service impact analysis:
	- When multiple root causes are known, the analytics system's output is used to determine and rank the relative impact, so that resources can be devoted to correcting the fault in the most timely and cost-effective way possible.
+ Complement best-of-breed technology:
	- The models, structures and pattern descriptions of IT infrastructure or application stack being monitored are used to correct or extend the outputs of other discovery-oriented tools to improve the fidelity of information used in operational tasks (e.g., service dependency maps, application runtime architecture topologies, network topologies).
+ Real time application behavior learning:
	- Learns & correlates the behavior of Application based on user pattern and underlying Infrastructure on various application patterns, create metrics of such correlated patterns and store it for further analysis.
+ Dynamically baselines threshold:
	- Learns behavior of Infrastructure on various application user patterns and determines the Optimal behavior of the Infra and technological components, bench marks and baselines the low and high water mark for the specific environments and dynamically changes the bench mark baselines with the changing infra and user patterns without any manual intervention




Types of ITOA:
+ Log analysis
+ Unstructured text indexing, search and inference (UTISI)
+ Topological analysis (TA)
+ Multidimensional database search and analysis (MDSA)
+ Complex operations event processing (COEP)
+ Statistical pattern discovery and recognition (SPDR)

##	 Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations, AIOps



Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is an industry category for machine learning analytics technology that enhances IT operations analytics.


Goals of AIOps:
+ enable IT transformation
+ receive continuous insights that provide continuous fixes and improvements via automation



AIOps can be viewed as CI/CD for core IT functions.
+ Given the inherent nature of IT operations, which is closely tied to cloud deployment and the management of distributed applications, AIOps has increasingly led to the coalescence of machine learning and cloud research.



main aspects of an AIOps platform:
+ machine learning
+ big data

In order to collect observational data and engagement data that can be found inside a big data platform, which requires a shift away from sectionally segregated IT data, a holistic machine learning and analytics strategy is implemented with the combined IT data.





AIOps tasks include:
+ automation
+ performance monitoring
+ event correlations



AIOps process:
+ The *normalized data* is suitable to be processed through machine learning algorithms to *automatically reduce noise* and *identify the probable root cause of incidents*.
	- The main output of such stage is the ***detection of any abnormal behavior from users, devices or applications***.
+ Noise reduction can be done by various methods, but most of the research in the field points to the following actions:
	- Analysis of all incoming alerts;
	- Remove duplicates;
	- Identify the false positives;
	- Early *anomaly, fault and failure* (AFF) detection and analysis.[13]
+ ***Anomaly detection*** - another step in any AIOps process is based on the analysis of past behavior of users, equipment and applications. Anything that strays from that behavior baseline is considered unusual and flagged as abnormal.
+ ***Root cause determination*** is usually done by passing incoming alerts through algorithms that take into consideration correlated events as well as topology dependencies. The algorithms on which AI are basing their functioning can be influenced directly, essentially by "training" them.


Applications of AIOps:
+ analysis of large and unconnected datasets, or large number of un-normalized databases
	- including aggregated data
+ Automation of tasks (DevOps)
+ Machine learning platforms
+ Augmented reality
+ Agent-based simulations
+ Internet of things (IoT)
+ AI Optimized Hardware
+ Natural language generation
+ Streaming data platforms
+ Conversational BI and analytics





Notes:
+ In database normalization, unnormalized form (UNF), also known as an unnormalized relation or non first normal form (N1NF or NF^2),[1] is a database data model (organization of data in a database) which does not meet any of the conditions of database normalization defined by the relational model. Database systems which support unnormalized data are sometimes called non-relational or NoSQL databases. In the relational model, unnormalized relations can be considered the starting point for a process of normalization. It should not be confused with denormalization, where normalization is deliberately compromised for selected tables in a relational database.
