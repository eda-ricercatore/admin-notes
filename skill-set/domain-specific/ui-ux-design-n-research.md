##	UX Research



UX research is an iterative process that can be used at anytime during product development and is a core part of user-centered design.



UX research helps businesses and organizations improve their products and services by helping them better understand:
+ Who their users are;
+ What their users are trying to achieve/ what their needs are;
+ How do their users currently try to do things, and what are the current pain points;
+ What is the best way to help users achieve their tasks.

There are various benefits to conducting user research more than just designing better products and services. Understanding what people want before releasing products in the market will help save money. Additionally, user research helps to gather data that can help influence stakeholders' decisions based on evidence and not opinions.




Types of User Research
+ Generative or exploratory research
	- Generative research or exploratory research is done to understand and define the problems to solve for users in the first place. It can be used during the initial stages of product development to create new solutions or it can be applied to an existing product to identify improvements and enhancements. Interviews, observational studies, secondary research, etc., are some of the common methods used during this phase. These methods are used to answer broad and open questions, where the aim is to identify problems users might be experiencing. Usually, the data collected through generative research must be synthesized in order to formulate the problems to be solved, for whom and why it is important.
+ Descriptive or explanatory research
	- Descriptive research or explanatory research helps to define the characteristics of the problem and populations previously identified. It is used to understand the context of the problem and the context in which users have the problem. The methods in this phase can be very similar to the methods used in the generative research phase. However, this phase helps to identify what is the best way to solve a problem as opposed to what problem to solve. During this phase, experts in the problem area are consulted to fill knowledge gaps that will be required to create a solution. This phase is required to avoid making assumptions about the problem or people that might otherwise result in a biased solution. The aim of this phase is to get a good understanding of the problem, to get the right solution ideas.
+ Evaluative research
	- Evaluative research is used to test the solution ideas to ensure they work and solve the problems identified. Ideas are usually tested by representatives from the target population. This is an iterative process and can be done on prototype versions of the solution. The commonly used method in this phase is called usability testing and it focuses on measuring if the solution addressed the intended problem. Users can also be asked to provide their subjective opinion about the solution, or they can be given a set of tasks to observe if the solutions is intuitive and easy to use. In simple words, evaluative research assess whether the solution fits the problem and whether the right problems were addressed.
+ Causal research
	- Causal research typically answers why something is happening. Once the solution is up and running, one can observe how people are using it in real time and understand why it is or isn't used the way the solution was envisioned. One of the common methods used in this phase is A/B testing.






Axes of a 3-D framework from the Nielsen Norman group to facilitate decision making about which method for UX research to use:
+ Attitudinal vs. behavioral
	- This distinction is the contrast between what people say and what people do. Attitudinal research is used to study users' perceptions, beliefs, opinions and what they think about a certain product or problem. Whereas, behavioral research measures how people really use a product. Interview studies, focus groups, surveys and diary studies often measure attitudes. Some usability studies that look how people use products can fall under behavioral research. Web analytics and click rates provide a good behavioral measure.
+ Qualitative vs. quantitative:
	- Qualitative research help generate data by asking users about their attitudes through open ended questions via surveys, interviews, and observing behaviors directly. Quantitative research aims to measure attitudes and behaviors via surveys and analytics. The contrast lies in the ability to analyze data, quantitative research typically use mathematical analysis where the instrument of data collection gathers data that can be coded numerically whereas in qualitative research analysis is not mathematical. Affinity diagraming, thematic analysis, grounded theory, are some commonly used qualitative analysis methods.
+ Context of use:
	- This describes how participants are using the product in question and whether they are using it in the first place. Products can be used in a natural or near natural setting where there is minimum interference from the researchers and this method provides data with great validity but lacks the ability to ask clarifying questions to users. Scripted use of the product are typically used in lab based or usability studies where the goal is to test or know about very specific aspects of the product. Some exploratory studies like interviews are done when a product does not exist yet or users' perception about a product is gathered when the product in question is not in use.







Qualitative UX research methods:
+ User Interviews
+ Guerilla testing
+ Focus Groups
+ Participatory Design
+ Diary studies
+ Card Sorting
+ Usability Studies (moderated/unmoderated)
+ Ethnographic studies


Quantitative UX research methods:
+ surveys
+ eye tracking
+ Web analytics
+ A/B testing
+ quantitative usability testing




+ skill set:
	- Interest in using data and user research to inform product decisions. Experience with effective A/B testing is a plus.
	- Ability to think holistically about a complex, social product, and map big picture metrics to a realistic actionable plan.
	- Passion for experimentation and new ideas.
