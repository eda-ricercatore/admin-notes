###	Application Domains of Computational *X*: Emerging Technologies


Emerging technologies that would be interesting application domains of computational *X*, especially computational engineering:
+ [***atomtronic circuit***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomtronics)
	- gravimetry
	- quantum computing
	- rotational sensing via the Sagnac effect
+ ***4-dimensional printing***, ***4-D printing***, 4-D bioprinting, ***active origami***, or ***shape-morphing systems***
	- uses ***programmable matter***
		* ["Programmable matter is matter which has the ability to change its physical properties (shape, density, moduli, conductivity, optical properties, etc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or autonomous sensing. Programmable matter is thus linked to the concept of a material which inherently has the ability to perform information processing."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_matter)
			+ Robotics-based approaches
				- ***self-reconfiguring modular robotics***
					* Or, ***modular reconfigurable robotics***
					* Or, ***modular reconfigurable robot systems, MRRs***
					* Or, ***modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems***
					* ["are autonomous kinematic machines with variable morphology"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reconfiguring_modular_robot)
					* stochastic reconfiguration
					* deterministic reconfiguration
				- claytronics
				- cellular automata
			+ ***Metamaterials*** are examples of programmable matter.
				- ["Metamaterials are artificial composites that can be controlled to react in ways that do not occur in nature."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_matter)
				- ["A metamaterial (from the Greek word μετά meta, meaning "beyond" and the Latin word materia, meaning "matter" or "material") is any material engineered to have a property that is not found in naturally occurring materials. They are made from assemblies of multiple elements fashioned from composite materials such as metals and plastics. The materials are usually arranged in repeating patterns, at scales that are smaller than the wavelengths of the phenomena they influence. Metamaterials derive their properties not from the properties of the base materials, but from their newly designed structures. Their precise shape, geometry, size, orientation and arrangement gives them their smart properties capable of manipulating electromagnetic waves: by blocking, absorbing, enhancing, or bending waves, to achieve benefits that go beyond what is possible with conventional materials."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial)
				- ["Metamaterial research is interdisciplinary and involves such fields as electrical engineering, electromagnetics, classical optics, solid state physics, microwave and antenna engineering, optoelectronics, material sciences, nanoscience and semiconductor engineering"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial)
				- optical filters
				- medical devices
				- sensor detection and infrastructure monitoring
				- smart solar power management
				- crowd control
				- high-frequency battlefield communication
				- lenses for high-gain antennas
				- improving ultrasonic sensors
				- shielding structures from earthquakes
	- "the resulting 3D shape is able to morph into different forms in response to environmental stimulus"
	- "4th dimension being the time-dependent shape change after the printing"
	- 4-D product, four-dimensional product
		* ["A four-dimensional product (4D product) considers a physical product as a life-like entity capable of changing form and physical properties autonomously over time. It is an evolving field of product design practice and research linked to similar concepts at the material scale (programmable matter and four-dimensional printing), however, typically utilizes sensors and actuators in order to respond to environmental and human conditions, modifying the shape, color, character and other physical properties of the product. In this way 4D products share similarities with responsive architecture, at the more human scale associated with products."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-dimensional_product)
+ ***Responsive computer-aided design, responsive CAD, responsive design***
	- ["Responsive computer-aided design (also simplified to responsive design) is an approach to computer-aided design (CAD) that utilizes real-world sensors and data to modify a three-dimensional (3D) computer model. The concept is related to cyber-physical systems through blurring of the virtual and physical worlds, however, applies specifically to the initial digital design of an object prior to production. ... The process begins with a designer creating a basic design of an object using CAD software with parametric or algorithmic relationships. These relationships are then linked to physical sensors, allowing them to drive changes to the CAD model within the established parameters. Reasons to allow sensors to modify a CAD model include customizing a design to fit a user's anthropometry, assisting people without CAD skills to personalize a design, or automating part of an iterative design process in similar fashion to generative design. Once the sensors have affected the design it may then be manufactured as a one-off piece using a digital fabrication technology, or go through further development by a designer."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_computer-aided_design)
		* ["Participatory design (originally co-operative design, now often co-design) is an approach to design attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of design and is not a design style. The term is used in a variety of fields e.g. software design, urban design, architecture, landscape architecture, product design, sustainability, graphic design, planning, and even medicine as a way of creating environments that are more responsive and appropriate to their inhabitants' and users' cultural, emotional, spiritual and practical needs. It is one approach to placemaking."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design)
			+ ["Participatory design has been used in many settings and at various scales. For some, this approach has a political dimension of user empowerment and democratization. [3] For others, it is seen as a way of abrogating design responsibility and innovation by designers."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design)
			+ ["Public interest design is a human-centered and participatory design practice that places emphasis on the 'triple bottom line' of sustainable design that includes ecological, economic, and social issues and on designing products, structures, and systems that address issues such as economic development and the preservation of the environment. Projects incorporating public interest design focus on the general good of the local citizens with a fundamentally collaborative perspective."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest_design)
	- ["Responsive computer-aided design is enabled by ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things, concepts which describe the capacity for everyday objects to contain computing and sensing technologies. It is also enabled by the ability to directly manufacture one-off objects from digital data, using technologies such as 3D printing and computer numerical control (CNC) machines. Such digital fabrication technologies allow for customization, and are drivers of the mass-customization phenomenon. They also provide new opportunities for consumers to participate in the design process, known as co-design (or participatory design). ... As these concepts mature, responsive design is emerging as an opportunity to reduce reliance on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) as the only method for designers and consumers to design products,[3] aligning with claims by Golden Krishna that "the best design reduces work. The best computer is unseen. The best interaction is natural. The best interface is no interface."[4] Calls to reduce reliance on GUIs and automate some of the design process connects with Mark Weiser's original vision of ubiquitous computing."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_computer-aided_design)
+ design computing, design and computation, and computational design

+ Responsive architecture
	- ["Responsive architecture is an evolving field of architectural practice and research. Responsive architectures are those that measure actual environmental conditions (via sensors) to enable buildings to adapt their form, shape, color or character responsively (via actuators). ... Responsive architectures aim to refine and extend the discipline of architecture by improving the energy performance of buildings with responsive technologies (sensors / control systems / actuators) while also producing buildings that reflect the technological and cultural conditions of our time. ... Responsive architectures distinguish themselves from other forms of interactive design by incorporating intelligent and responsive technologies into the core elements of a building's fabric. For example: by incorporating responsive technologies into the structural systems of buildings architects have the ability to tie the shape of a building directly to its environment. This enables architects to reconsider the way they design and construct space while striving to advance the discipline rather than applying patchworks of intelligent technologies to an existing vision of 'building'."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_architecture)
+ active structure
	- ["An active structure (also known as a smart or adaptive structure) is a mechanical structure with the ability to alter its configuration, form or properties in response to changes in the environment."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_structure)
