##	Skill Set for Compiler Design

Notes:
+ Compiler design involves code optimization (with the intermediate representation, and during code generation - such as instruction scheduling and register allocation), rather than merely than implementing interpreters that translate source code to binaries/executables.
	- Other steps in code generation do not need optimization, such as debug data generation.
	- Instruction selection can involve optimization to select the set/sequence of instructions that would allow the software, or computer program, to execute with the fastest time.
+ This set of positions target parallel compiler design (e.g., sequential source code to parallel source code), and standard/traditional/classic compiler design.
	- For compiler design positions related to domain-specific languages, in the context of domain-specific computing, see the list for [EDA, Machine Learning, and AI]()
+ Checking for compiler correctness, including translation validation, can involve formal verification.

	- Innovation is at the heart of GrammaTech. We are constantly pushing the boundaries of software research and development – from software assurance and software integrity to cyber-security threat mitigation and autonomic computing. 
	- GrammaTech was founded over 30 years ago, with a firmly-grounded purpose to help organizations develop tomorrow’s software.  Given the ever-increasing dependence of software in today’s connected world, our staff is able to focus on the most challenging software issues through a constant stream of highly innovative research and commercial development programs – focused on the evolving cyber-security landscape, software hardening and intelligent systems.  Within these projects, GrammaTech employees have the opportunity to work with industry, academic, and government experts, significantly advancing their skills in engineering, research, marketing, or sales.
+ skill set:
	- GrammaTech’s Common Lisp Software internship program offers students the opportunity to gain real experience in a friendly, open, and supportive environment. We choose projects based on real needs, and interns work closely with engineers to make sure that projects are completed successfully.  Current COMMON LISP IS REQURED FOR THIS ROLE.
	- GrammaTech will conduct a series of programming tests and screening interviews in Common Lisp as part of our process. (Please do not apply if you do not have experience with Lisp, unfortunately, we cannot train for this role.)  
	- GrammaTech employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
	- Location:  Remote (must be in USA Only) with a possibility of being located in our Ithaca, NY office for the summer.  (COVID Restrictions will be considered as we get closer to the summer.)
	- Responsibilities
		* Research projects at GrammaTech can take on a wide variety of topics and challenges. Projects focus on software assurance, software protection, reverse engineering, and software transformation. We do both static and dynamic analysis on both source and object code, in order to tackle serious problems with practical solutions.
		* Potential projects include:
			+ Apply compiler optimizations to binaries. Develop some classic compiler optimizations on top of our Binary IR (https://grammatech.github.io/gtirb/)
			+ Develop source-code program transformations for refactoring, optimization, and diversification on top of our Software Evolution Library (https://grammatech.github.io/sel)
			+ Design and run large-scale experiments evaluating automated software modification and automated software engineering tools
	- Required Qualifications
		* Currently enrolled in a BS, MS, or PhD program
		* Excellent programming skills with Common LISP (required)
	- Preferred Qualifications
		* Enrollment in a Computer Science PhD program
+ skill set:
	- The primary responsibility is leading efforts to design and implement research prototypes, based on ideas drawn from academic literature and original research. Team size varies from project to project. On small projects, a scientist may implement a significant portion of the prototype, while on larger projects they will lead a team of engineers. Our scientists are expected to:
		* Generate ideas for innovative solutions (original or drawn from the literature) that address needs identified by research sponsors
		* Translate research ideas into working prototypes
		* Manage researchers and engineers implementing research prototypes: identify risks, plan work, monitor progress, review designs and code used in prototypes, as well as adapt plans as we learn more about the sponsor’s needs and the benefits/deficiencies of the prototype
		* Write proposals for research contracts
		* Build and maintain relationships with research sponsors
		* Document research results in written reports. Present results in-person at meetings with research sponsors
		* Work with research sponsors to ensure success of any demonstrations or evaluations of the research prototype
		* Promote research results in blogs, external presentations, and publications
		* Collaborate with product and marketing teams to identify a strategy to turn the research prototype into a marketable product
		* Ph.D. in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Software Engineering and a minimum of three years of industry or post-doctoral academic experience
		* Experience leading research projects and managing/supervising a research team, as Principal Investigator (PI) or equivalent
		* Research experience in compilers, static analysis, language-based security, or another field aligned with GrammaTech's research activities. Maybe your area of expertise is reverse engineering, or vulnerability detection, or code transformation. Expertise in machine learning or statistical techniques with applications to software development or security is highly relevant, as well. On the other hand, maybe you will be adding a new area of expertise to our team
		* Lots of languages: C, C++, Java, machine code, etc. It's not just about our own code, it's about taking other people's software apart and showing them what makes it tick
+ skill set:
	- end-to-end workload analysis from low-level assembly instruction code to high-level distributed algorithms
	- experience with performance analysis on:
		* CPUs
		* GPUs
		* TPU
		* parallel architectures or distributed systems
		* dataflow or spatial architctures
		* many-core multi-thread environments.
