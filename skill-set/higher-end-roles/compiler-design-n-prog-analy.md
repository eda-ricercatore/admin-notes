#	Compiler Design and Program Analysis



##	Skill Set for Compiler Design

Notes:
+ Compiler design involves code optimization (with the intermediate representation, and during code generation - such as instruction scheduling and register allocation), rather than merely than implementing interpreters that translate source code to binaries/executables.
	- Other steps in code generation do not need optimization, such as debug data generation.
	- Instruction selection can involve optimization to select the set/sequence of instructions that would allow the software, or computer program, to execute with the fastest time.
+ This set of positions target parallel compiler design (e.g., sequential source code to parallel source code), and standard/traditional/classic compiler design.
	- For compiler design positions related to domain-specific languages, in the context of domain-specific computing, see the list for [EDA, Machine Learning, and AI]()
+ Checking for compiler correctness, including translation validation, can involve formal verification.
