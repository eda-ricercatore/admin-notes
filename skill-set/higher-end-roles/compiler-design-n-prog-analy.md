#	Compiler Design and Program Analysis



##	Skill Set for Compiler Design

Notes:
+ Compiler design involves code optimization (with the intermediate representation, and during code generation - such as instruction scheduling and register allocation), rather than merely than implementing interpreters that translate source code to binaries/executables.
	- Other steps in code generation do not need optimization, such as debug data generation.
	- Instruction selection can involve optimization to select the set/sequence of instructions that would allow the software, or computer program, to execute with the fastest time.
+ This set of positions target parallel compiler design (e.g., sequential source code to parallel source code), and standard/traditional/classic compiler design.
	- For compiler design positions related to domain-specific languages, in the context of domain-specific computing, see the list for [EDA, Machine Learning, and AI]()
+ Checking for compiler correctness, including translation validation, can involve formal verification.

	- Programming Language Engineer
	- We're looking to hire a Software Engineer with experience working on programming languages to join us. Jane Street's Compilers team focuses on improving OCaml as a foundation for our ever-growing technology stack, in collaboration with the greater OCaml community. We work on many different aspects of the language, aiming to make it easier for developers to express their ideas in OCaml, to improve the performance of the generated code, and to make the OCaml compiler itself faster and easier to use. 
	- Over the years, we’ve extended the type system with support for novel language features, re-engineered the optimizer ground-up, and added feedback-directed optimization. We also extend and enhance the surrounding toolchain, working on tools for profiling, debugging and generating documentation. The vast majority of our work is open-source, and we upstream as much as we can to the mainstream OCaml compiler.
	- If you’ve worked on a production compiler in industry or on research compilers in an academic setting, you might have a strong foundation for this role. No previous experience with OCaml or functional programming languages is required. Fluency in English is required.

		* Type systems that track locality and uniqueness
	- During the internship, you will work in collaboration with your mentors on one project for about 10-12 weeks. You’ll learn how we use OCaml in our day-to-day work, and gain exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems. You’ll gain a better understanding of the wide range of problems we solve every day. You’ll try out new ideas and apply state-of-the art research to a large actively-developed production codebase.
	- You’ll also be able to access our physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and hopefully get a real sense of what it would be like to work here full time.
