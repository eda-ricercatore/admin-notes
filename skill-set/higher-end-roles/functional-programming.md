		* We are curious and eager to learn about a number of different systems and how they fit together. This gives us a breadth of knowledge and opportunities to collaborate with many other dev and business teams across the firm
		* We spend less time in total coding (due to the support rotation), and are interrupted more often, and we enjoy adding value to Jane Street in this way
		* We get satisfaction from helping others, enabling good trades, and getting to the bottom of complex and urgent production issues
	* We don’t expect you to have a background in functional programming, finance, or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart software developers who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than just what you currently know.
	- A strong programmer with a love for technology; able to write and read code well
	- An intellectually curious person who is motivated, collaborative, and eager to learn
	- An excellent communicator, able to be clear and calm during production incidents
