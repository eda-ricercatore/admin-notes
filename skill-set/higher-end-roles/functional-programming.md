##	Generic Sets of Skills for Software Development, Using Functional Programming


Generic sets of skills in software development, using functional programming:
+ skill set:
	- Software Engineer
	- LOCATION: New York
	- DEPARTMENT: Technology
	- TEAM: Software Engineering
	- We're always hiring software engineers for all of our offices. Technology is at the core of how we approach our work, and engineers are intimately tied in to every area of the business. 
	- We are big believers in functional programming, using OCaml, a statically-typed functional programming language, as our primary development language. We also believe in the value of open source software, using it in our daily work and releasing hundreds of thousands of lines of our own code as open source.
	- Top-notch programming skills
	- Deep experience with - and love for - technology. There's no specific checklist; we use software to approach a variety of problems, so we're interested in everything from machine learning to systems administration to programming language design
	- Strong interpersonal skills. Software engineering at Jane Street is highly collaborative, and we are looking for people who can work effectively in small, close-knit teams
	- We don’t expect you to have experience with functional programming, OCaml, or finance; we’re happy to hire talented engineers and teach them what they need to know. 
	- If you'd like to get an idea of what we cover in our software engineering interview process, you can read our series of blog posts discussing what we do and don't look for.

	- Software Engineer
	- LOCATION: New York
	- DEPARTMENT: Technology
	- TEAM: Software Engineering
	- We’re looking for Software Engineers who want to help us design and build the systems and tools that run the firm. You’ll find Software Engineers in all parts of Jane Street, solving real problems in critical areas ranging from trading desks to our accounting team, as well as building foundational infrastructure, whether that means implementing network monitoring or risk models. We are big believers in functional programming, and use OCaml as our primary development language (we have the largest team of OCaml developers in any industrial setting). 
	- Beyond our own environment, we also recognize the value of open source software, leveraging it in our daily work and releasing hundreds of thousands of lines of our own code as open source. We’re also always looking for ways to expand open source projects, and provide ongoing support to things like Mercurial, the OCaml compiler, and the OPAM package manager. That said, we’re interested in talented engineers with experience in any language—most of us came in with little to no practical experience in OCaml before we joined. 
	- We don’t expect you to have a background in functional programming, finance, or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart programmers who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:
		* A top-notch programmer with a love for technology
		* Intellectually curious, collaborative, and eager to learn
		* Humble and unafraid to ask questions and admit mistakes
	- Base salary is $250,000. Base salary is only one part of Jane Street total compensation, which includes an annual discretionary bonus.
+ Software Engineer Internship, January-April
	- LOCATION: New York
	- DEPARTMENT: Technology
	- TEAM: Software Engineering
	- Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at Jane Street full time. Over the course of your internship, you will explore ways to approach and solve exciting problems within your field of interest through fun and challenging classes, interactive sessions, and group discussions—and then you will have the chance to put those lessons to practical use.
	- As an intern, you are paired with full-time employees who act as mentors, collaborating with you on real-world projects we actually need done. When you’re not working on your project, you will have plenty of time to use our office amenities, physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and engage with the parts of our work that excite you the most.
	- If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.
	- As a Software Engineering intern, you’ll learn how we use OCaml (our primary development language) in our day to day work, and gain exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems.
	- During the program you’ll work on two projects, mentored closely by the full-time employees who designed them. Some projects consider big-picture questions that we’re still trying to figure out, while others involve building something new. Your mentors will work in two distinct areas, so you’ll gain a better understanding of the wide range of problems we solve every day, from high performance trading systems to programming language design and everything in between.
	- We don’t expect you to have a background in finance, OCaml, functional programming, or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart people who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know. You should be:

	- Production Engineer
	- LOCATION: Singapore
	- DEPARTMENT: Technology
	- TEAM: Software Engineering
	- We are hiring Production Engineers in our Hong Kong and Singapore office. Jane Street Production Engineers are software developers who spend time both developing software and also providing high-quality support for software systems that are critical to Jane Street's trading business.
	- Many of our Production Engineers are embedded in various software teams; others are in standalone teams. In both situations we work alongside application developers with a common goal of creating and running great software systems. As a firm we are big believers in functional programming, and use OCaml as our primary development language.
	- Production Engineers play an essential role interacting with a wide variety of departments and functions at Jane Street. We solve real-time issues and make a firm-wide impact. We take ownership of the architecture and design of systems that monitor and support the firm’s trading. We also design and develop the tools that we use, and it feels great to be able to shape these tools and then enjoy the improvements.
	- https://www.janestreet.com/production-engineering/
	- How is a Production Engineer role different from a generic Software Engineering role?
		* We split our time between OCaml software development project work and a support rotation, in which we actively resolve live issues in Jane Street’s critical systems
		* We are curious and eager to learn about a number of different systems and how they fit together. This gives us a breadth of knowledge and opportunities to collaborate with many other dev and business teams across the firm
		* We spend less time in total coding (due to the support rotation), and are interrupted more often, and we enjoy adding value to Jane Street in this way
		* We get satisfaction from helping others, enabling good trades, and getting to the bottom of complex and urgent production issues
	* We don’t expect you to have a background in functional programming, finance, or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart software developers who enjoy solving interesting problems. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than just what you currently know.
	- A strong programmer with a love for technology; able to write and read code well
	- An intellectually curious person who is motivated, collaborative, and eager to learn
	- An excellent communicator, able to be clear and calm during production incidents
	- Fluency in English required
