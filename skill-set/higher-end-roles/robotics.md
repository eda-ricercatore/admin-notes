##	Notes About Robotics


Robot classifications include:
+ autonomously guided robots, robots with sliding autonomy, remote-operated robots (telerobotics)
+ behavior-based robotics, BBR, or behavioral robotics
+ mobile robots, and stationary robots





Types of mobile robots, or 
+ unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are autonomous.
	- UGVs can be remotely controlled by people.





This document does not include agriculture robotics, which information is provided in the agricultural technologies document.



Interesting topics in robotics:
+ self-reconfiguring modular robots, self-reconfigurable modular robots, modular self-reconfiguring robotic systems
	- architectures
		* chain architecture
		* hybrid architecture
		* lattice architecture
	- types of reconfiguration
		* deterministic reconfiguration
		* stochastic reconfiguration
	- designs of modules
		* heterogeneous modular robot systems
		* homogeneous modular robot systems
	- mechanism reconfigurability
		* inter-reconfigurability
		* intra-reconfigurability
		* nested-reconfigurability

			+ ["Adaptive technology and assistive technology are different. Assistive technology is something that is used to help disabled people, while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for disabled people and would seldom be used by a non-disabled person. In other words, assistive technology is any object or system that helps people with disabilities, while adaptive technology is specifically designed for disabled people. Consequently, adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology. Adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology)

##	Sets of Skills in Machine Vision



["Machine vision (MV) is the technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection, process control, and robot guidance, usually in industry. Machine vision refers to many technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision, a form of computer science. It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems. The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environment vehicle guidance."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_vision)
+ Machine vision is distinct from computer vision, but can be overlapping/intersecting.
