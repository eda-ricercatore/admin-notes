In other words, assistive technology is any object or system that helps people with disabilities, while adaptive technology is specifically designed for disabled people. Consequently, adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology. Adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology)

##	Sets of Skills in Machine Vision



["Machine vision (MV) is the technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection, process control, and robot guidance, usually in industry. Machine vision refers to many technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision, a form of computer science. It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems. The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environment vehicle guidance."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_vision)
+ Machine vision is distinct from computer vision, but can be overlapping/intersecting.

	- Fundamental understanding of Bundle Adjustment or Non-Linear Optimization.
	- PhD or exceptional MSc involving 3D-Reconstruction, SLAM, Camera Calibration or Computational Geometry from a top ranking university or lab.
	- Geometry from Vision is at the heart of Scape Technologies. As a research engineer on the Scape Technologies team, you will take a key role in designing and building the pipeline for cloud-based 3D-reconstruction and real-time global localization. This will require implementing and building upon existing research in Structure-from-Motion, Dense 3D-reconstruction, Camera Calibration and SLAM.
	- This can range from non-linear optimization to efficient graph traversal, considering optimized computational parallelization.
	- Making sure that Scape's large scale reconstruction and localization pipeline is the most efficient in the world.
