## R&D roles in Bio Design Automation, BDA

+ skill set:
	- You will lead key customer software efforts starting from requirements gathering and architecture formulation through development, testing, and deployment cycles. You will build technically and aesthetically crisp software in a primarily reactive web programming environment. The stack will vary based on customer specifications, so flexibility is preferred to strict adherence to one specific stack, but ReactJS + GraphQL + NoSQL + Typescript is our most utilized set of technologies. Coding quality and robust functionality is most important, regardless of language.
	- You will work with a team of experts in algorithms, software design, synthetic biology, and interface design. Your role will include the translation of algorithms and application requirements into feasible architectures, and ultimately, into code that is performant, readable, and flexible. As a leading member of the software team you will also engage in project management activities including but not limited to customer engagement, project task management, scheduling, and recruitment of new programming talent.
	- Requirements gathering from customers and R&D partners.
	- Developing and deploying shippable code for customer projects.
	- Maintaining a pulse on current software tools and trends in relevant areas of synthetic biology.
	- Collaborating with the Lattice development team to conceptualize, develop, and deploy state-of-the-art software solutions for synthetic biology.
	- Promoting and facilitating exposure of Lattice computational innovations to the synthetic biology community.
	- Creating, maintaining, and documenting a world-class codebase.
	- Managing development and deployment infrastructure.
	- You have a proven track record of designing and implementing innovative solutions to challenging computational problems (experience building scalable, reactive SPAs is a big plus).
	- Proficient knowledge of the current Javascript technologies landscape (ReactJS, Angular, and Typescript experience preferred).
	- Strong experience with data transformation and management technologies (GraphQL, REST, MongoDB, etc.)
	- Familiarity with package management tools (npm, yarn, etc.).
	- Exposure to server and deployment technologies (NodeJS, Docker, AWS, etc.).
	- Understanding of software engineering best practices and testing frameworks.
+ skill set:
	- You are passionate about synthetic biology and its potential. You are interested in developing computational approaches to synthetic biology and seeing them have an impact in real customer engagements. You are interested in furthering your education related to synthetic biology. You want to directly work with software engineers to see algorithms and technology directly translated into software artifacts. You are interested in engaging public audiences on the potential of Lattice approaches. You want to curate, maintain, and develop new and existing customer relationships. You are interested in working with lawyers to create material to help Lattice create patents and trademarks. You want to have a set of small internal software programming projects.
	- PhD and/or MBA in Computer Science/Engineering, Math, Bioengineering, or closely related Molecular Biology based field. Technical background preferred over business background.
	- Peer reviewed publications related to the development of computational approaches applied to biological problems. h-index greater than 10 a plus.
	- Experience with programming (Javascript, Java, Perl/Python preferred).
	- Experience developing algorithmic approaches to problems and evaluating their effectiveness.
	- Management experience a plus. You will likely have to oversee a team of 3-4 engineers.
	- Grant writing, reporting, and management a plus. Experience with SBIR awards also a plus.
	- Develop technical solutions to customer problems and communicate these to software engineering staff. This includes small internal software programming projects.
	- Pursue, develop, and maintain new customer engagements.
	- Pursue, develop, and maintain external funding sources (grants, awards, etc.).
	- Maintain high level of knowledge on current computational synthetic biology developments.
	- Work with customers to test Lattice software and translate customer feedback into engineering milestones.
	- Work with legal team to protect Lattice IP.
	- Promote Lattice technology, products, and process in public venues, conferences, etc.

##	Applied Machine Learning Roles in the Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical Industry








+ tech stack:
	- You should think about joining us if you care about making a difference in treating disease and saving human lives. But also, if you are up to tackling some of the hardest open challenges in deep learning today:
		* Non-stationary, unbalanced, and noisy data: Our training data is seldom i.i.d.; new medicines are unlocked by pushing out into newly-discovered biology. Classes are extremely unbalanced, ratios of 1 positive to 70,000 negatives are typical. Help us reason about how to learn appropriately without dismissing nor overfitting to the data; identify when we can trust a label or have confidence in a prediction; and develop techniques to find and correct for systemic biases.
		* Extreme scaling: Medicinal chemists can synthesize about a trillion trillion molecules today. Help us scale predictive algorithms to orders of magnitude beyond those contemplated in any other problem domain today.
		* Multi-parameter optimization: Medicine has to be both safe and effective, so we have to concurrently optimize a number of criteria such as potency, selectivity, solubility, toxicity, synthesizability, etc. Help us efficiently explore the Pareto frontier and avoid mode collapse.
		* Adversarial generation of synthetic data: Data augmentation has shown utility in improving the robustness of predictions. Help us find ways to best integrate molecular physics simulation and machine learning to impute new data.
		* Explainability and visualization: Subtle patterns govern molecular recognition. Help us to understand how they lead to the discovery of fundamental chemistry by AI.
