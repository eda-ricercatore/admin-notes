##	Applied Machine Learning Roles in the Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical Industry








+ tech stack:
	- You should think about joining us if you care about making a difference in treating disease and saving human lives. But also, if you are up to tackling some of the hardest open challenges in deep learning today:
		* Non-stationary, unbalanced, and noisy data: Our training data is seldom i.i.d.; new medicines are unlocked by pushing out into newly-discovered biology. Classes are extremely unbalanced, ratios of 1 positive to 70,000 negatives are typical. Help us reason about how to learn appropriately without dismissing nor overfitting to the data; identify when we can trust a label or have confidence in a prediction; and develop techniques to find and correct for systemic biases.
		* Extreme scaling: Medicinal chemists can synthesize about a trillion trillion molecules today. Help us scale predictive algorithms to orders of magnitude beyond those contemplated in any other problem domain today.
		* Multi-parameter optimization: Medicine has to be both safe and effective, so we have to concurrently optimize a number of criteria such as potency, selectivity, solubility, toxicity, synthesizability, etc. Help us efficiently explore the Pareto frontier and avoid mode collapse.
		* Adversarial generation of synthetic data: Data augmentation has shown utility in improving the robustness of predictions. Help us find ways to best integrate molecular physics simulation and machine learning to impute new data.
		* Explainability and visualization: Subtle patterns govern molecular recognition. Help us to understand how they lead to the discovery of fundamental chemistry by AI.
