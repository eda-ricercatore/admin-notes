##	Skill Sets for Bioinformatics






Skill sets for bioinformatics:
+ skill set:
	- We have an opening for a bioinformatician in the Bedford lab at the Fred Hutch to work on genomic epidemiology and evolutionary analysis of pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, seasonal influenza, and other emerging and endemic pathogens. This position will contribute to ongoing work for the Bedford lab and Nextstrain.
	- Nextstrain is an award-winning project for tracking infectious disease epidemics developed in collaboration with the Neher lab at the University of Basel. Nextstrain won the Open Science Prize in Feb 2017 and has been instrumental in analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Ebola outbreaks, Zika spread in the Americas and is used by the World Health Organization to aid in the process of influenza vaccine strain selection. The software we write to power all parts of Nextstrain—bioinformatics, visualizations, analysis pipelines, data management, and more—is entirely open-source and available to the public. We work with public health entities and scientists across the world, both formally and informally, to expand pathogen surveillance capabilities and to improve the automation and robustness of these analyses. Our goal is to empower the wider genomic epidemiology and public health communities to tweak our analyses, create new ones, and communicate scientific insights using the same tools we do.
	- An ideal candidate would be local to the Seattle area or willing to relocate, but remote work is also an option.
	- This role advances the research aims of the Bedford lab and the Nextstrain team through a combination of independent work, collaboration with scientists and software developers in the group, and interactions with the wider public health and science communities.
	- Develop and maintain analytic pipelines such as those that clean and ingest genome metadata, build phylogenetic trees, and run forecasting models for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens
	- Improve the robustness, automation, and monitoring of our existing pathogen pipelines
	- Develop reproducible pipelines to expand surveillance of endemic and emerging human pathogens, in collaboration with both internal and external groups
	- Participate in community outreach through office hours, discussion forums, and mailing lists
	- Write and maintain thorough documentation on software and pipelines
	- Design software with a diverse range of collaborators and users in mind
	- Contribute to the Nextstrain team's decision-making and planning processes
	- Present at Bedford lab meetings
	- Master’s degree in bioinformatics, computational biology, biology, or related field with at least three years’ direct experience in computational analysis of large sequence-based molecular data sets.
	- Fluency in at least one high-level programming language, such as Python, R, Ruby, JavaScript, or Perl
	- Familiarity with version control and other software development best practices
	- Experience with workflow managers such as Snakemake, Nextflow, or WDL
	- Knowledge of molecular biology
	- Motivated to learn new skills and technologies and collaborate within an existing team’s practices
	- Excellent written and verbal communication skills
	- Expertise in genomics
	- Knowledge of automated testing and workflows such as GitHub Actions
	- Experience configuring and deploying analyses on a cloud infrastructure







































##	Applied Machine Learning Roles in the Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical Industry








+ tech stack:
	- You should think about joining us if you care about making a difference in treating disease and saving human lives. But also, if you are up to tackling some of the hardest open challenges in deep learning today:
		* Non-stationary, unbalanced, and noisy data: Our training data is seldom i.i.d.; new medicines are unlocked by pushing out into newly-discovered biology. Classes are extremely unbalanced, ratios of 1 positive to 70,000 negatives are typical. Help us reason about how to learn appropriately without dismissing nor overfitting to the data; identify when we can trust a label or have confidence in a prediction; and develop techniques to find and correct for systemic biases.
		* Extreme scaling: Medicinal chemists can synthesize about a trillion trillion molecules today. Help us scale predictive algorithms to orders of magnitude beyond those contemplated in any other problem domain today.
		* Multi-parameter optimization: Medicine has to be both safe and effective, so we have to concurrently optimize a number of criteria such as potency, selectivity, solubility, toxicity, synthesizability, etc. Help us efficiently explore the Pareto frontier and avoid mode collapse.
		* Adversarial generation of synthetic data: Data augmentation has shown utility in improving the robustness of predictions. Help us find ways to best integrate molecular physics simulation and machine learning to impute new data.
		* Explainability and visualization: Subtle patterns govern molecular recognition. Help us to understand how they lead to the discovery of fundamental chemistry by AI.
	- Ph.D. or M.Sc. in computer science, statistics, data science, or related field
	- 5+ years of extensive practical experience and proven track record of developing, implementing, debugging, and extending machine learning algorithm
	- Knowledge of modern neural network frameworks such as Tensorflow, Torch, or Theano
	- Strong analytical and statistical skills
	- Scientific rigor, healthy skepticism, and detail-orientation in running and analyzing experiments
	- Familiarity with processing large data sets in a Linux environment
	- Software engineering skills and coding experience in at least one high-level programming language (Python, R, Java, C/C++, etc.)
	- Biomedical knowledge or experience in processing chemical or biological data is preferred but not required
	- Experience with cloud computing environments (AWS/Azure/GCE)
