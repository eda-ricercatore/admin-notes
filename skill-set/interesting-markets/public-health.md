Our mission to “make biology easier to engineer” is poised to disrupt multiple industries by leveraging our innovative data, automation, and scale capabilities in biological engineering. 
	- Ginkgo believes that if we are to grow a thriving, sustainable bioeconomy, we must also grow a new market in biosecurity. Our biosecurity and public health initiative, Concentric by Ginkgo, launched a nationwide emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing end-to-end pathogen monitoring services to schools, communities, and travelers. As we continue to scale Concentric, our work is also evolving into new and exciting directions, from global expansion to the integration of new technologies and capabilities, including our Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance Plan with the CDC. 
	- To help facilitate this initiative we’re looking for a talented Engineering Manager who is still willing to contribute to code, to join our team.  With your expertise, you’ll help to build our Concentric platform to deliver insights gathered from testing programs across a wide variety of pathogens and test modalities and a growing lab network. You’ll collaborate with a team of talented and diverse engineers, product managers, designers, experts in data analysis, and, of course, our customers.  This is your chance to not only develop algorithms and frameworks at the cutting edge of software technologies, but also work side-by-side with the brightest scientists, engineers, and more.
	- Our tech stack includes AWS, Aptible, Docker, Flask, Kubernetes, Postgres, and other modern tools and frameworks. Our languages of choice are Python and React. Additionally, for key projects, your expertise in Java, Tomcat and Angular will come in handy. While we don't expect you to be an expert in every platform, we do expect that you have a solid foundation in computer science and be able to master the technologies that we use today (and will adopt tomorrow). Additionally, even if you don’t have a background in biology, you must be passionate about Concentric’s goal of being the premier partner for data gathering and insight generation to organizations like the CDC around the world. 
	- Manage a team of 4-5 people, helping them with career guidance and making sure they have what they need to be successful at Ginkgo
	- Design and implement software solutions that address the current needs of Concentric’s customers, partners, and internal stakeholders. These solutions could be a microservice, standalone tool, user-facing web application, data pipeline, etc.
	- Collaborate with your tech lead and product manager to define milestones and deliverables.
	- Work as a member of an agile team, attend scrum meetings, and review code produced by your peers.
	- Write automated tests for your solution and oversee its deployment.
	- Monitor the production environment to detect and address customers' issues.
	- Prototype new ideas, algorithms, and frameworks.
	- Minimum Requirements
		* BS in related field 
		* Minimum 5 years of related industry experience
		* Management experience 
		* Proven track record in full-stack development
		* Experience with building distributed systems
		* Experience with code management systems, CI/CD, AWS, or any other cloud experience
