	- The XPRIZE will launch a $101M Healthspan XPRIZE to incentivize teams worldwide to advance therapeutics to clinical trials that can improve health and function in older adults. The prize is anticipated to build one of the world’s leading clinical trials networks for aging and geroscience intervention studies and biomarker consortium. These early-stage trials (e.g. phase I and proof-of-concept) to enhanced phase II trials will range in scale from dozens to hundreds of human subjects research trials that will be conducted both within the US and by international teams. Key investigational agents include pharmacologic (new or repurposed), stem cell, medical device, lifestyle, health behavior, and personalized medicine approaches either alone or in combination. Teams will test the ability of their investigational agent or therapeutic approach to improve function and health across multiple physiologic systems in older adults. Trials are anticipated to use traditional double-blind placebo controlled trials or cross-over design trials, or may use innovative designs, such as adaptive design, n-of-1 and aggregate n-of-1 trials, etc. We will engage in a federated trials network, such that competing teams will be responsible for their own regulatory compliance, data and safety monitoring, and power and sample size justifications. However, we will engage or develop a XPRIZE Healthspan data management system to track team engagement, recruitment, basic monitoring, endpoint data for adjudication, and medical and safety event tracking as needed.
	- The Biostatistician or Data Scientist will play a lead role in the XPRIZE Healthspan prize team in the design and analysis of clinical trials, working in close collaboration with Health Domain leaders, Prize Operations and IT, as well as competing teams and analysts. The Biostatistician will join an exceptional team at XPRIZE, with latitude to conduct methodologic research in clinical trial design and analysis topics, drawing on common data from upcoming trials. The position is ideally suited for people with MS-level training or higher in biostatistics or statistics, but we will consider exceptional candidates with a combination of a bachelor’s degree and relevant experience working on clinical trials, clinical research, biomarker development and validation, or machine learning.
	- Work with Healthspan Domain Leader and prize design team on competition design (e.g., modeling trajectory of change in multiple health endpoints, event rate calculations, sample size, sampling approaches)
	- Develop statistical analysis plans for overall prize, prize milestone awards, and trials
	- Lead interim and primary endpoint analyses for overall prize design and milestones
	- Work with investigators and teams and interface with team data and safety monitoring committees to monitor trials, including discussing results from closed (masked) interim efficacy and futility analyses
	- Work with and mentor/advise analysts to develop:
		* reproducible, computational workflows
		* automated team and study monitoring reports
		* database and electronic data collection design
		* secondary outcome analyses for existing trials who will expand testing for consideration as a competing team
	- The Biostatistician or Data Scientist can engage in specialized research. Screening of applicants will begin immediately and will continue as needed throughout the prize launch and recruitment period. Salary and rank will be commensurate with the applicants experience and training.
	- Candidates must possess (or in process of obtaining) a Master’s degree in biostatistics, statistics, or related discipline plus at least 4 year’s experience working as a statistician on prospective clinical trials, clinical research, or biomarkers development and machine learning. 
	- Applicants must have obtained the degree requirement or equivalent competencies by the time of hire.
	- Familiarity with epidemiologic trial design and conduct.
	- Strong analytical skills: should be adept at programming and data analysis (preferably R and Python; other languages welcome).
	- Strong data management skills: should be comfortable overseeing and maintaining programs for data collection, analysis, and reporting.
	- Experience working with teams of data scientists and multidisciplinary clinical research teams.
	- Good communication (writing and speaking).
	- Publication records commensurate with experience, with an emphasis on collaborative contributions.
	- Applicant’s materials must list (pending) qualifications upon submission.
	- 4 or more years of experience working as a statistician on prospective clinical trials, clinical research, or biomarker development and validation.
	- Experience with causal inference methods (e.g., DAGs, structural causal models), and transparent/ reproducible data science tools (e.g., GitHub, R markdown).
	- Experience and/or interest in international research.
	- Experience and/or interest in adaptive designs.
	- Interest in clinical trial methodology.
	- Interest in biomarker development and validation.
	- Highly collaborative individual who can work well with others, internally and externally
	- Action oriented and results driven
	- Organized and highly analytical and detail oriented
	- Able to manage and thrive in ambiguity
	- Communicates effectively and professionally
	- Manages complexity
	- Able to plan, align and direct the work of others
	- Global and future forward perspective
	- Able to drive results and measure them through analytics
	- The anticipated base salary for this position is $90-$120k and may also qualify for an annual incentive.
