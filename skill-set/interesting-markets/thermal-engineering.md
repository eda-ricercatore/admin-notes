##	Skill Sets for Thermal Engineers



Skill sets for thermal engineers:
+ skill set:
	- The Thermal Engineering Design Team at NVIDIA is seeking a Thermal Engineering Intern who will contribute to thermal designs, testing, characterization, and prototyping activities as related to NVIDIAâ€™s GeForce (gaming), Quadro (workstation), TESLA (High performance compute), and possibly server products. Be an integral member of a collaborative team which defines and develops thermal solutions from concept through production working with multi-functional Product Development teams and overseas partners. Your proven communication skills, strong thermal and validation engineering technical background with product development knowledge including thermal engineering and related manufacturing processes, are important.
	- As a team, we support all products NVIDIA develops. Your contribution will be towards the development, specifications, design, and manufacturing implementation from package to board level thermal solutions through complete systems including implications focusing on GeForce, Quadro, and TESLA products including development of thermal technologies.
	- Part of your responsibility is the investigation of relevant product design concepts, perform analysis and trade-offs aligned with product goals, and contributing to thermal solution product design from beginning to end (i.e. conceptualization to production).
	- We build physical prototype assemblies and instrument those assemblies for testing. We carry out testing, summarize and correlate data, modify, and improve our systems.
	- One of the team's responsibilities is to build test reports and summaries, and generally detail your efforts to broaden the knowledge of your team and the company.
	- Working towards a BS or MS or equivalent experience in Engineering (ME, Mechanical Systems, Physics or similar with emphasis on heat transfer and design).
	- Experience in visualizing and clarifying product/solution needs from fundamental concepts through system considerations to ensure optimized designs.
	- Experience with FEA/CFD theory, and general analysis of heat transfer tools including excellent knowledge of at least one thermal analysis SW would be very beneficial.
	- Hands-on experience and proficiency in thermal evaluation of computer hardware to provide relevant and data driven product design suggestions (i.e. thermocouple placement, acquiring readings using automated data acquisition, assembly and tear downs) are required.
	- Experience with CFD tools including IcePak, Fluent, or FloTHERM.
	- Experience using a flow bench for characterizing heat sinks, fans, and systems.
	- Background in a thermal laboratory environment and tools related to making accurate thermal measurements and related data collection for electronics (i.e. temperature, power, voltages, multimeters, and more).
	- Familiar with NVIDIA's GPU and SOC products.
