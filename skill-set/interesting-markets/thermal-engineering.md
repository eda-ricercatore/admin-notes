##	Skill Sets for Thermal Engineers



Skill sets for thermal engineers:
+ skill set:
	- The Thermal Engineering Design Team at NVIDIA is seeking a Thermal Engineering Intern who will contribute to thermal designs, testing, characterization, and prototyping activities as related to NVIDIA’s GeForce (gaming), Quadro (workstation), TESLA (High performance compute), and possibly server products. Be an integral member of a collaborative team which defines and develops thermal solutions from concept through production working with multi-functional Product Development teams and overseas partners. Your proven communication skills, strong thermal and validation engineering technical background with product development knowledge including thermal engineering and related manufacturing processes, are important.
	- As a team, we support all products NVIDIA develops. Your contribution will be towards the development, specifications, design, and manufacturing implementation from package to board level thermal solutions through complete systems including implications focusing on GeForce, Quadro, and TESLA products including development of thermal technologies.
	- Part of your responsibility is the investigation of relevant product design concepts, perform analysis and trade-offs aligned with product goals, and contributing to thermal solution product design from beginning to end (i.e. conceptualization to production).
	- We build physical prototype assemblies and instrument those assemblies for testing. We carry out testing, summarize and correlate data, modify, and improve our systems.
	- One of the team's responsibilities is to build test reports and summaries, and generally detail your efforts to broaden the knowledge of your team and the company.
	- Working towards a BS or MS or equivalent experience in Engineering (ME, Mechanical Systems, Physics or similar with emphasis on heat transfer and design).
	- Experience in visualizing and clarifying product/solution needs from fundamental concepts through system considerations to ensure optimized designs.
	- Experience with FEA/CFD theory, and general analysis of heat transfer tools including excellent knowledge of at least one thermal analysis SW would be very beneficial.
	- Hands-on experience and proficiency in thermal evaluation of computer hardware to provide relevant and data driven product design suggestions (i.e. thermocouple placement, acquiring readings using automated data acquisition, assembly and tear downs) are required.
	- Experience with CFD tools including IcePak, Fluent, or FloTHERM.
	- Experience using a flow bench for characterizing heat sinks, fans, and systems.
	- Background in a thermal laboratory environment and tools related to making accurate thermal measurements and related data collection for electronics (i.e. temperature, power, voltages, multimeters, and more).
	- Familiar with NVIDIA's GPU and SOC products.
+ skill set:
	- Thermal Engineer
	- Cupertino, CA
	- Etched is building AI chips that are hard-coded for individual model architectures. Our first product (Sohu) only supports transformers, but has an order of magnitude more throughput and lower latency than a B200. With Etched ASICs, you can build products that would be impossible with GPUs, like real-time video generation models and extremely deep chain-of-thought reasoning.
	- We are seeking a highly experienced Senior Thermal Engineer to join our team and lead our efforts in optimizing thermal management for high-performance systems. As a Senior Thermal Engineer at Etched, you will play a crucial role in developing and implementing advanced thermal management solutions for our high-performance data center products. Your expertise in water cooling, thermal simulations, and cooling system design will be essential in ensuring optimal thermal performance and reliability. You will work with various water cooling components, including internal manifolds, quick disconnects, CDU (Coolant Distribution Units), heat exchangers, and advanced thermal interface materials.
	- Lead the design and optimization of thermal management systems for high-performance data center products, focusing on water cooling solutions and advanced cooling concepts.
	- Develop and implement water cooling solutions, including internal manifolds, quick disconnects, CDUs (Coolant Distribution Units), and heat exchangers. Ensure effective cooling and thermal management for high-power processors and other critical components.
	- Design and manage direct-to-processor water cooling systems to efficiently dissipate heat and maintain optimal operating temperatures.
	- Conduct detailed thermal simulations to predict and analyze thermal performance. Use simulation results to guide the design and optimization of cooling systems.
	- Evaluate and select thermal interface materials (TIMs) for various heat sinks and cooling solutions. Optimize TIM performance to enhance thermal conductivity and heat dissipation.
	- Explore and implement advanced thermal cooling concepts, including phase change cooling, liquid cooling, and other cutting-edge technologies.
	- Oversee the testing and validation of thermal management systems to ensure they meet performance, reliability, and efficiency standards. Address any issues related to thermal performance and provide solutions.
	- Create and maintain comprehensive documentation for thermal management designs, including design specifications, simulation results, and testing reports. Report on performance and any issues identified during testing.
	- Work closely with cross-functional teams, including mechanical engineers, electrical systems engineers, and vendors, to ensure seamless integration and operation of thermal management solutions.
	- A Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering or Thermal Engineering, or a related field. Advanced degrees or certifications in thermal management or related areas are highly desirable.
	- A Minimum of 10 years of experience in thermal engineering with a strong focus on water cooling systems and advanced thermal management solutions. Proven expertise in designing and managing direct-to-processor cooling systems and thermal simulations.
	- Extensive experience with water cooling systems, including internal manifolds, quick disconnects, CDUs, and heat exchangers
	- Expertise in direct-to-processor cooling solutions and thermal management for high-power components
	- Proficiency in thermal simulation tools and techniques to predict and analyze thermal performance
	- Knowledge of various thermal interface materials (TIMs) and heat sink designs
	- Experience with advanced thermal cooling concepts and technologies.
	- We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.
	- Etched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single-model ASICs.
	- We are a fully in-person team in Cupertino, and greatly value engineering skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.
	- Full medical, dental, and vision packages, with 100% of premium covered, 90% for dependents
	- Housing subsidy of $2,000/month for those living within walking distance of the office
	- Daily lunch and dinner in our office
	- Relocation support for those moving to Cupertino
