#	Skill Sets for Virtualization



+ skill set:
	- Virtualization is a key technology that enables modern data center to be operated in an elastic and cost efficient manner. In the post Moore era, when performance growth cannot sustain due to semiconductor technology slow-down, new computing architectures such as ***non-volatile memory, disaggregated fabric, heterogeneous multi-processing***... etc. are emerging in data center, which suggest us to also redefine the virtualization stack.
	- Assist research work on current and future trend in virtualization technology.
	- Track technical trend worldwide in virtualization and cloud; deliver technical insight report.
	- Participate in the design and development of proof of concepts, demonstrators, and testbeds.
	- Investigate and prototype new techniques in next generation virtualization technology.
	- Master in computer science or other domain-related disciplines.
	- Proficient in C/C++ and system level programming.
	- Scripting language and open source toolchains.
	- Experienced in ***Linux kernel and virtualization with QEMU/KVM***.
	- Motivation for technical challenges.
	- Team player, excellent intercultural communication and coordination skills.
	- Fluent written and spoken English.
