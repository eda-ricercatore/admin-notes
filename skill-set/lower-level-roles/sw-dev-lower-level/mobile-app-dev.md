#	Mobile App Development



##	Notes for Mobile App Development


reactive programming = asynchronous dataflow programming
+ functional reactive programming, FRP, is based on the building blocks of functional programming
	- map
	- reduce
	- filter
	- applications of FRP, by simplifying problems via the explicit modeling of time, include:
		* graphical user interfaces, GUI, development
		* robotics
		* games
		* music




##	Skill Sets for Mobile App Development

+ skill set:
	- Senior Mobile Engineer (iOS)
