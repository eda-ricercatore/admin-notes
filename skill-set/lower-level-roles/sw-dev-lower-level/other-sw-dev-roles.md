	- CAP theorem, or Brewer's theorem, in system design and theoretical CS guarantees:
		* consistency: every read receives the most recent write or an error
			+ different from consistency definition in ACID properties
		* availability: each request receives a non-error response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
		* partition tolerance: system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped or delayed by the network between nodes
		* When a network partition failure occurs, it has to do one of the following:
			+ cancel the operation and decrease the availability but ensure consistency
			+ proceed with the operation and provide availability but risk inconsistency
		* therefore, when a design choice for network partition is made, it has to choose between consistency and availability.
