	- Senior Software Engineer, Storage
	- Bad software is everywhere, and we’re tired of it. Sentry is on a mission to help developers write better software faster, so we can get back to enjoying technology.
	- With more than $217 million in funding and 85,000 organizations that believe we’re on to something, we're building performance and error monitoring tools that help companies like Disney, Microsoft, and Atlassian spend less time fixing bugs and more time building products. If you like to selfishly build things that make your digital life better, come help us build the next generation of software monitoring tools.
	- The Search and Storage team is responsible for the infrastructure that powers all of Sentry's time-series data and searching capabilities across billions of events with sub-second latency. We started this initiative by building Snuba, the primary storage and query service for Sentry's event data powered by ClickHouse, and we're now looking to provide even more visibility and reporting on the terabytes of data that our users send us. The storage sub-team is specifically concerned with ingesting and storing the input data (thousands of events per second) that come from our customers into ClickHouse.

	- Have experience with distributed systems, but are looking for exposure to higher scale. We process tens of thousands of events/second — scaling on the storage team isn’t just “put a cache in front of it”
	- Have a vigilant eye for the mixing of infrastructure and business logic concerns. We try to push business logic out of our team’s code and into the product
	- Want opportunities to improve process. This team grew organically out of an operational need for higher-scale data storage, and we’re working incrementally to give product teams more autonomy to build products without involving us as much as today

	- QML
		* Qt QML
			+ "The Qt QML module provides a framework for developing applications and libraries with the QML language. It defines and implements the language and engine infrastructure, and provides an API to enable application developers to extend the QML language with custom types and integrate QML code with JavaScript and C++. The Qt QML module provides both a QML API and a C++ API.
			+ https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-index.html
			+ "QML is a declarative language that allows user interfaces to be described in terms of their visual components and how they interact and relate with one another. It is a highly readable language that was designed to enable components to be interconnected in a dynamic manner, and it allows components to be easily reused and customized within a user interface. Using the QtQuick module, designers and developers can easily build fluid animated user interfaces in QML, and have the option of connecting these user interfaces to any back-end C++ libraries.""
			+ https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmlapplications.html
			+ "QML is a multi-paradigm language for creating highly dynamic applications. With QML, application building blocks such as UI components are declared and various properties set to define the application behavior. Application behavior can be further scripted through JavaScript, which is a subset of the language. In addition, QML heavily uses Qt, which allows types and other Qt features to be accessible directly from QML applications."
			+ https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qmlreference.html
			+ "QML (Qt Modeling Language[4]) is a user interface markup language. It is a declarative language (similar to CSS and JSON) for designing user interface–centric applications. Inline JavaScript code handles imperative aspects. It is associated with Qt Quick, the UI creation kit originally developed by Nokia within the Qt framework. Qt Quick is used for mobile applications where touch input, fluid animations and user experience are crucial. QML is also used with Qt3D[5] to describe a 3D scene and a "frame graph" rendering methodology. A QML document describes a hierarchical object tree. QML modules[6] shipped with Qt include primitive graphical building blocks (e.g., Rectangle, Image), modeling components (e.g., FolderListModel, XmlListModel), behavioral components (e.g., TapHandler, DragHandler, State, Transition, Animation), and more complex controls (e.g., Button, Slider, Drawer, Menu). These elements can be combined to build components ranging in complexity from simple buttons and sliders, to complete internet-enabled programs.""

	- React
		* React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
	- DDP: Delivered Duty Paid
		* Delivered duty paid (DDP) is a delivery agreement whereby the seller assumes all of the responsibility, risk, and costs associated with transporting goods until the buyer receives or transfers them at the destination port.
		* Datagram Delivery Protocol, a networking protocol in the AppleTalk suite
		* Differential dynamic programming, a second-order algorithm for trajectory optimization
			+ Differential dynamic programming (DDP) is an optimal control algorithm of the trajectory optimization class. 
			+ Interior Point Differential dynamic programming (IPDDP) is an interior-point method generalization of DDP that can address the optimal control problem with nonlinear state and input constraints.
		* Distributed Data Protocol, a client-server protocol for querying and updating a database
		* Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) is a member of the AppleTalk networking protocol suite. Its main responsibility is for socket-to-socket delivery of datagrams over an AppleTalk network.
