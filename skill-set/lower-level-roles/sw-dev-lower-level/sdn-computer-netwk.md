##	Distributed Computing






+ skill set:
	- Experience in building and owning critical user-facing API systems, and solving scaling, latency, and performance problems in high-volume low-latency distributed systems
	- 8+ years of industry experience with distributed systems, transactional data stores, and systems programming
+ Experience with MapReduce/Hadoop and/or distributed systems.
+ skill set:
	- Proficient programmer that can code efficient algorithms (like map-reduce, preferably in Java) that traverse data partitioned in a distributed architecture
	- Design, build, and deploy distributed querying strategy to achieve highly scalable and resilient transactional processing and reporting for different size and shape workloads
	- Perform analysis on data access patterns to uncover opportunities to improve query throughput and drive decision making on new architectures. Recommend best practices.
	- Design efficiently distributed query service for low latency access and traversal for transactional and reporting use cases
	- Influence and collaborate cross functional teams in coming together towards a common, data architecture
	- Learn and fundamentally understand the Workday technology stack including a home-grown meta-data driven application development environment
	- Be responsible for system stability by proactively identifying and diagnosing issues and rapidly deploying code to address production issues
	- Strong coding experience in any language
	- Good working experience of distributed systems gossip protocols and consensus algorithms
	- Experience implementing distributed computing frameworks and architectures
	- Good knowledge of network protocols, routing and handshaking
	- Good experience performance tuning/ garbage collection / JVM internals
	- Proficient knowledge of maintaining and debugging live, business critical software systems
	- Good understanding and hands on experience with SQL, especially in the area of data aggregation and query performance tuning
	- Communicates clearly to engineering peers including ability to identify and communicate data-driven insights
+ Experience working with distributed computing tools like Spark or Hadoop
