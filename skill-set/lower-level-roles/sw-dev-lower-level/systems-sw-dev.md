##	Skill Sets for Systems Software Development




+ skill set:
	- System Software engineer, Staff
	- SiFive is seeking an experienced System Software Engineer for our System Software group.  The SiFive System Software group develops critical software components for our Core and Intelligence processors, from firmware and bare-metal to high-level OS and AI runtime code.  The team is global, spanning several worldwide sites, working together as one group.   We believe that engineers create most of the value in the company.  Our management chain has a strong engineering and software development background.  We believe in open, honest, and direct communication; mutual respect; and seek strong communicators and listeners.
	- As a System Software Engineer, you will work with system architecture and hardware engineering teams to help design and evaluate systems, including CPUs, interconnects, firewalls, and related IP blocks.  You’ll work with our software group to design software implementations that take advantage of hardware features and integrate cleanly with existing operating systems, such as Linux. You’ll write software for Linux kernel, device drivers, OpenSBI, u-boot, Yocto/OpenEmbedded. You’ll be a part of creating something big, all based around the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
	- Design, develop, upstream and release system software: Linux kernel, device drivers, OpenSBI, u-boot, Yocto/OpenEmbedded (both SiFive-proprietary and public open source)
	- Engage with architecture, hardware engineering, and other software engineering teams to review, and refine features
	- At least 3 years of experience developing architecture-level code or device drivers in C for multiprocessor, multithreaded open source kernels such as Linux or BSD, with upstream involvement
	- Proven experience with upstream development on high-level operating systems such as Linux
	- Strong communication, co-working, and listening skills
	- Experience working with hardware architecture and engineering teams
	- Experience debugging complex multicore systems
	- Experience debugging with GDB, JTAG and OpenOCD
	- Experience with git, Makefile, GNU toolchain and shell scripting
	- Experience with device drivers, virtualization, IOMMUs, PCIe, power management or SoC platform security
	- Experience with Android bring up and development
+ skill set:
	- Rust Software Engineer
	- Serokell is a fast-growing, fully-remote software development company that works on innovative solutions for complex problems. We’re packed full of adventurous, curious, and inclusive folks that want to build cutting-edge software with modern technologies like functional programming.
	- We’re seeking a Rust software engineer to join a team of fierce and fun Serokellers.
	- Solid knowledge of the modern Rust language. You are expected to comfortably use enums, references, lifetimes, generics, standard and custom traits, be familiar with the standard library, know how to organize a project with modules and crates, etc.
	- Async programming with Rust. You should be comfortable with writing multi-threaded code and are expected to be familiar with the concepts of tokio, even though working experience with it is not a requirement.
	- Application-level integration. You should be able to integrate your code with a wide variety of other systems. Experience with various databases and database client libraries is a plus. Experience making API clients is plus. Experience making Web and API servers is a plus.
	- Unit and property testing. You are expected to write well-tested code (with tests that catch likely defects and are not too hard to maintain).
	- Familiarity with Logging and tracing. Experience organizing logging, tracing, and monitoring (also, working with logs and metrics aggregation systems) is a bonus.
	- Knowledge of the fundamental algorithms and data structures like binary search tree, DFS, hashtable, quicksort, etc.
	- Knowledge of computer networks: HTTP, TCP/IP stack, understanding of poll- and push-based data synchronization models and their usage in modern service APIs.
	- Familiarity with tools used for build/deploy automation and CI/CD: Docker, Nix, Kubernetes, etc.
	- Good coding culture (code structuring and decoupling, using git and pull requests, code review practices).
	- Good level of self-organization.
	- Develop robust, scalable, and maintainable Rust applications, adhering to best practices and coding standards.
	- Participate in code reviews, providing constructive feedback and ensuring code quality.
	- Debug and resolve technical issues, identifying and implementing effective solutions.
