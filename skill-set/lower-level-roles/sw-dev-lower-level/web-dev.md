##	Back-end Web Development, Server-side Scripting, or Microservices





+ Strong familiarity with server-side web technologies (eg: Nodejs, Java, Python, Scala)
+ skill set:
	- Expertise in Golang and proficiency in other languages (Preferably C/C++,NodeJs, Python).
	- Commercial experience with REST, RPC and message exchange protocols.
		* REST
			+ Representational state transfer (REST), a software architecture
				- REST (Representational state transfer) is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasises the scalability of interactions between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a layered architecture to facilitate caching of components to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.
			+ reStructuredText (ReST or reST), a file format for textual data
				- reStructuredText (RST, ReST, or reST) is a file format for textual data used primarily in the Python programming language community for technical documentation.
		* RPC
			+ In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is written as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly writing the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPCs are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures are largely the same whether they are local or remote, but usually, they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.
			+ RPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine, they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the physical address space is different. Many different (often incompatible) technologies have been used to implement the concept.
	- Experience with frameworks such as: Gin, Gorilla, Dep, Ginkgo
		* Gin, Gin Web Framework, full-featured web framework for Go
			+ martini: Classy web framework for Go
		* Gorilla: Web toolkit for the Go programming language that provides useful, composable packages for writing HTTP-based applications.
		* Dep
		* Ginkgo
			+ Ginkgo is a testing framework for Go programming language, which is designed to facilitate writing behavior-driven (BDD) tests. It provides a simple and intuitive syntax for writing test suites, cases and assertions, making it easier to write, read and maintain tests.
			+ Ginkgo is a mature testing framework for Go designed to help you write expressive specs.
	- Knowledge around message queuing and distributed tasking (SMS,ZeroQ, RabbitMQ etc)
		* ZeroQ
			+ ZEROQ enables mixed-precision quantization without any access to the training or validation data. This is achieved by optimizing for a Distilled Dataset, which is engineered to match the statistics of batch normalization across different layers of the network. ZEROQ supports both uniform and mixed-precision quantization.
			+ ZeroMQ (also spelled ØMQ, 0MQ or ZMQ) is an asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker; the zero in the name is for zero broker. The library's API is designed to resemble Berkeley sockets.
			+ ZeroMQ is developed by a large community of contributors, founded by iMatix, which holds the domain name and trademarks. There are third-party bindings for many popular programming languages.
		* RabbitMQ
			+ RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that originally implemented the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.
			+ RabbitMQ is the most widely deployed open source message broker.
			+ RabbitMQ is compared with Apache Kafka

Splunk is looking for Software Engineers to join the effort to define and create the future of Splunk. You will be joining a team that's developing our Federated Search infrastructure used for searching data in Splunk and a variety of other big-data systems
	- We give our engineers an environment in which they can impact from day one while also providing opportunities for learning and growth. You'll learn how our entire stack works - from data ingestion and storage to searching, reporting, and building dashboards – all in distributed environments. The work you’ll do will directly impact the experience of our customers.
	- We are an engineering- and product-focused company. Our engineers take a leading role in designing, architecting, building and testing our product. Engineers at Splunk have a wide impact, from developing new capabilities like metrics ingestion and analysis to working with customers to see their work be used to solve real-world problems.
	- Opportunities to develop and grow as an engineer. We are at the forefront of our industry, always expanding into new areas, and working with open source and new technologies.
	- A set of hardworking and dedicated peers, all the way from engineering and QA to product management and customer support.

	- Growth and mentorship. We believe in growing engineers through ownership and leadership opportunities. We also believe mentors help both sides of the equation.
	- A stable, collaborative and supportive work environment. We work in an open environment, have a shared kitchen and sit down for a quick sync every morning.
	- Balance. We don't expect people to work 12 hour days. We want you to have a successful time outside of work too. Want to work from home sometimes? No problem. We trust our colleagues to be responsible with their time and commitment and believe that balance helps cultivate a positive environment.
	- Desire to Learn and Adapt. We have a lot of projects going on at once, and you'll have to learn to navigate the code and features. You'll constantly be learning new areas and new technologies.
