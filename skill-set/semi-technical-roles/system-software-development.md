	- SiFive is seeking an experienced System Software Engineer for our System Software group.  The SiFive System Software group develops critical software components for our Core and Intelligence processors, from firmware and bare-metal to high-level OS and AI runtime code.  The team is global, spanning several worldwide sites, working together as one group.   We believe that engineers create most of the value in the company.  Our management chain has a strong engineering and software development background.  We believe in open, honest, and direct communication; mutual respect; and seek strong communicators and listeners.
	- As a System Software Engineer, you will work with system architecture and hardware engineering teams to help design and evaluate systems, including CPUs, interconnects, firewalls, and related IP blocks.  You’ll work with our software group to design software implementations that take advantage of hardware features and integrate cleanly with existing operating systems, such as Linux. You’ll write software for Linux kernel, device drivers, OpenSBI, u-boot, Yocto/OpenEmbedded. You’ll be a part of creating something big, all based around the RISC-V instruction set architecture.
	- Design, develop, upstream and release system software: Linux kernel, device drivers, OpenSBI, u-boot, Yocto/OpenEmbedded (both SiFive-proprietary and public open source)
	- Engage with architecture, hardware engineering, and other software engineering teams to review, and refine features
	- At least 3 years of experience developing architecture-level code or device drivers in C for multiprocessor, multithreaded open source kernels such as Linux or BSD, with upstream involvement
	- Proven experience with upstream development on high-level operating systems such as Linux
	- Strong communication, co-working, and listening skills
	- Experience working with hardware architecture and engineering teams
	- Experience debugging complex multicore systems
	- Experience debugging with GDB, JTAG and OpenOCD
