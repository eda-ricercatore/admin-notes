+ skill set:
	- At Ashby, we’re on a mission to help professionals excel at their jobs with software. We believe current software is barely scratching the surface and the most promising productivity improvements haven’t materialized yet.
	- We’re starting with a suite of products that help talent leaders, recruiters, and managers excel at hiring. Prior to starting Ashby, our Co-Founder and CEO, Benji, experienced the limitations of current products first hand. This experience has created a relentless focus to solve recruiting’s toughest problems with powerful and delightful software.
	- We’ve not launched publicly yet, but we already have amazing (paying) customers, such as Opendoor, Plaid, Figma, Airtable, Snyk, and Benchling and we’re backed by great investors, including YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. We’ll share more once we meet.
	- We've only scratched the surface of how Ashby can help our customers, it's the perfect time to join.
	- Here are a few key points that should give you an idea of what it is like to work with us:
		* We invest a lot in common building blocks that allow us to build powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is an in-house design system and a set of common components (analytics modelling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine) which we are constantly improving.
		* Customers use Ashby every day, so we put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.
		* We strongly believe that small teams with very talented people (and the right work environment) deliver much better performance than teams with large headcount. We hire and compensate accordingly.
		* Our users’ pain is our pain. Engineers conduct user interviews, slack with our customers, and work closely with them to define, design, and implement solutions.
		* We rigorously protect the team’s time so we can maximize our impact. We invest a lot in asynchronous communication, automation, and research. 
	- We value a strong sense of ownership, principled thinking over experience, and thoughtful communication (we put a lot of effort into using the right communication channels) - we’ll get into these and other values during the hiring process.
	- We believe the best designs come from engineers with an eye for visual design; we don’t have designers who can’t code at Ashby. In particular, we love people who have a deep understanding of CSS and experience building reusable and extensible components.
	- As a design engineer, you will lead the visual and experience design of our design system, its translation to React components, and consult or lead design for new features. We love to work with engineers who are product and design-minded.
	- Our technology stack is: SCSS (with CSS modules) or Stitches, TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis. You’ll be our resident expert on frontend technology and best practices like React, CSS, semantic HTML, and accessibility.
	- One formality, we require at least 1.5 years of experience as a full-time software engineer or designer for this role.
	- You Could Be a Great Fit If
		* Empowering other engineers to build well-designed features through a design system excites you.
		* You believe great visual design balances usability and beauty; you’ll, for example, pick a less appealing interface that packs more information on screen over one that doesn’t.
		* You lean heavily on design patterns and systems but know when a feature needs bespoke work.
		* You believe great design comes through iteration, collaboration, and responding to customer feedback.
		* Every time you see a great design or interaction on the web, your first reaction is to open the developer console.
	- We know this kind of talent is rare and we're excited to pay top of market to have you join us!
	- Here are examples of things you’ll work on:
		* Build a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes that can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.
		* Redesign our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.
		* Consult with other engineers to improve the UX and visual design of projects they’ve worked on.
	- Your First Two Months at Ashby
		* By the end of your second month, you’ll deliver at least one large, impactful feature from research to specification to delivery. We’ll help get you there by pairing you with another engineer to onboard you and introduce you to how Ashby delivers impactful changes to customers. On your first day, they’ll help you run a script to get your dev environment setup (it’s that easy!) and commit your first change to production. In your first two weeks, the team will introduce you to our customers, our product, and key architecture through training sessions. You’ll also fix bugs and add small features to Ashby to get familiar with our code base. From there, you’ll take on projects of increasing scope (with guidance from your onboarding engineer) until you’re ready to take on your large, impactful feature.
	- Benefits
		* You’ll get the time to do things the right way; we put a lot of emphasis on high quality work and avoid quick hacks as much as possible
		* You get to use your own product (we use Ashby for our own hiring!)
		* Top-of-market compensation including equity. We know this kind of talent is rare!
		* 10 year exercise window for stock options
		* Top notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us (U.S.)
		* 401(k) matching (U.S.)
+ skll set for UI engineer:
	- What You’ll Do:
		* Be a key member of the Anaconda Nucleus team that helps drive clarity and alignment across the team
		* You take ownership of team process inefficiencies, implement cross team efforts in ensuring things are running smoothly

##	UX Research


###	Notes about UX Research



UX research is an iterative process that can be used at anytime during product development and is a core part of user-centered design.



UX research helps businesses and organizations improve their products and services by helping them better understand:
+ Who their users are;
+ What their users are trying to achieve/ what their needs are;
+ How do their users currently try to do things, and what are the current pain points;
+ What is the best way to help users achieve their tasks.

There are various benefits to conducting user research more than just designing better products and services. Understanding what people want before releasing products in the market will help save money. Additionally, user research helps to gather data that can help influence stakeholders' decisions based on evidence and not opinions.




Types of User Research
+ Generative or exploratory research
	- Generative research or exploratory research is done to understand and define the problems to solve for users in the first place. It can be used during the initial stages of product development to create new solutions or it can be applied to an existing product to identify improvements and enhancements. Interviews, observational studies, secondary research, etc., are some of the common methods used during this phase. These methods are used to answer broad and open questions, where the aim is to identify problems users might be experiencing. Usually, the data collected through generative research must be synthesized in order to formulate the problems to be solved, for whom and why it is important.
+ Descriptive or explanatory research
	- Descriptive research or explanatory research helps to define the characteristics of the problem and populations previously identified. It is used to understand the context of the problem and the context in which users have the problem. The methods in this phase can be very similar to the methods used in the generative research phase. However, this phase helps to identify what is the best way to solve a problem as opposed to what problem to solve. During this phase, experts in the problem area are consulted to fill knowledge gaps that will be required to create a solution. This phase is required to avoid making assumptions about the problem or people that might otherwise result in a biased solution. The aim of this phase is to get a good understanding of the problem, to get the right solution ideas.
+ Evaluative research
	- Evaluative research is used to test the solution ideas to ensure they work and solve the problems identified. Ideas are usually tested by representatives from the target population. This is an iterative process and can be done on prototype versions of the solution. The commonly used method in this phase is called usability testing and it focuses on measuring if the solution addressed the intended problem. Users can also be asked to provide their subjective opinion about the solution, or they can be given a set of tasks to observe if the solutions is intuitive and easy to use. In simple words, evaluative research assess whether the solution fits the problem and whether the right problems were addressed.
+ Causal research
	- Causal research typically answers why something is happening. Once the solution is up and running, one can observe how people are using it in real time and understand why it is or isn't used the way the solution was envisioned. One of the common methods used in this phase is A/B testing.






Axes of a 3-D framework from the Nielsen Norman group to facilitate decision making about which method for UX research to use:
+ Attitudinal vs. behavioral
	- This distinction is the contrast between what people say and what people do. Attitudinal research is used to study users' perceptions, beliefs, opinions and what they think about a certain product or problem. Whereas, behavioral research measures how people really use a product. Interview studies, focus groups, surveys and diary studies often measure attitudes. Some usability studies that look how people use products can fall under behavioral research. Web analytics and click rates provide a good behavioral measure.
+ Qualitative vs. quantitative:
	- Qualitative research help generate data by asking users about their attitudes through open ended questions via surveys, interviews, and observing behaviors directly. Quantitative research aims to measure attitudes and behaviors via surveys and analytics. The contrast lies in the ability to analyze data, quantitative research typically use mathematical analysis where the instrument of data collection gathers data that can be coded numerically whereas in qualitative research analysis is not mathematical. Affinity diagraming, thematic analysis, grounded theory, are some commonly used qualitative analysis methods.
+ Context of use:
	- This describes how participants are using the product in question and whether they are using it in the first place. Products can be used in a natural or near natural setting where there is minimum interference from the researchers and this method provides data with great validity but lacks the ability to ask clarifying questions to users. Scripted use of the product are typically used in lab based or usability studies where the goal is to test or know about very specific aspects of the product. Some exploratory studies like interviews are done when a product does not exist yet or users' perception about a product is gathered when the product in question is not in use.







Qualitative UX research methods:
+ User Interviews
+ Guerilla testing
+ Focus Groups
+ Participatory Design
+ Diary studies
+ Card Sorting
+ Usability Studies (moderated/unmoderated)
+ Ethnographic studies


Quantitative UX research methods:
+ surveys
+ eye tracking
+ Web analytics
+ A/B testing
+ quantitative usability testing
