	- FPGA Engineer Internship, May-August
	- Our goal is to give you a real sense of what it’s like to work at Jane Street full time. Over the course of your internship, you will explore ways to approach and solve exciting problems within your field of interest through fun and challenging classes, interactive sessions, and group discussions—and then you will have the chance to put those lessons to practical use.
	- As an intern, you are paired with full-time employees who act as mentors, collaborating with you on real-world projects we actually need done. When you’re not working on your project, you will have plenty of time to use our office amenities, physical and virtual educational resources, attend guest speakers and social events, and engage with the parts of our work that excite you the most.
	- If you’ve never thought about a career in finance, you’re in good company. Many of us were in the same position before working here. If you have a curious mind, a collaborative spirit, and a passion for solving interesting problems, we have a feeling you’ll fit right in.
	- In this internship, you’ll learn how we use tools to make programming faster, more pleasant, and more reliable. We apply these same principles to our FPGA Engineering work, and we're looking for people who are interested in using programming language technology to improve the process of designing, testing, and validating hardware designs. We use Hardcaml, an OCaml library for succinctly describing hardware in RTL. Hardcaml is tightly integrated into our development environment, so you’ll also gain lots of exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems. No previous knowledge of Hardcaml is required.
	- During the program, you’ll dive deep on one project, mentored closely by the full-time employees who helped design it. Some intern projects consider big-picture questions that we’re still trying to figure out, while others involve building something new. Your mentors will help you gain a better understanding of the wide range of problems we solve every day.  We expect interns to build FPGA applications from concept to a working design; your projects will predominantly involve OCaml & Hardcaml, for both RTL design and testing/integration.
	- If you’d like to learn more, you can read about our interview process, meet some of our newest hires, or check out our OCaml All The Way Down talk and Programmable Hardware podcast episode.

	- Mixed-signal interfaces are the essential bridges between the physical world and the digital information processing backbone. In recent years, innovation in such interfaces has been increasingly fueled by application-level insight and the data-driven nature of modern systems. As a result, the traditional building block boundaries are blurring, and the extraction of information occurs through symbiotic interplay between analog and digital signal processing. In this talk, I will illustrate this trend using examples of small-scale machine learning and data analysis functions that operate at the physical interface. Specific examples include mixed-signal feature extraction circuits and compute fabric for machine learning inference, as well as data-compressive interfaces for high-dimensional sensor inputs.

	- Evolve, design and build new compiler intermediate representations for hardware design and tool flows.
	- Implement specific compiler optimization and lowering algorithms for chip design flows.
	- Implement state of the art mechanisms for hierarchical caching that crosscut compiler and build systems.
	- Participate in design discussions, planning, code review, documentation, open source processes, and other standard software practices.
	- Collaborate with hardware architects to develop the approach and design flows.
	- Manage your individual project priorities, deadlines and deliverables.
	- We are hiring for several positions with different levels of seniority, but require a minimum of 2 years of compiler engineering experience.
	- Strong oral and written communication skills, excellent team collaboration.
	- Experience with C++ programming and git-based development workflows.
	- Experience with Verilog and other chip design technologies is NOT required.
