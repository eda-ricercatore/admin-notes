	- FPGA Engineer
	- We are looking to hire an Engineer with experience in both software and hardware design to help us build our FPGA-based applications. 
	- We're big believers in the ability of tools to make programming faster, more pleasant, and more reliable. We apply these same principles to our FPGA Engineering work, and we’re looking for people who are interested in using programming language technology to improve the process of designing, testing, and validating hardware designs. We use Hardcaml, an OCaml library for succinctly describing hardware in RTL. Hardcaml is tightly integrated into our development environment, so you’ll also gain lots of exposure to the libraries and tools that are foundational to our internal systems. No previous knowledge of Hardcaml is required.
	- In this role, you’ll work on the ground-up design and implementation of new FPGA applications, and help extend and refine the high-level synthesis and testing tools that we use internally. Your day-to-day work will predominantly involve OCaml & Hardcaml, for both RTL design and testing/integration, but you can also expect to work with some Verilog and C. While you don’t need to have worked with OCaml specifically, a good background in some typed functional language is a plus.
	- We don’t expect you to have a background in OCaml, finance, or any other specific field—we’re looking for smart programmers who will approach hardware design with a software engineering mindset. We’re more interested in how you think and learn than what you currently know.
	- A top-notch programmer with a love for technology
	- Comfortable with a software programming language
	- Intellectually curious, collaborative, and eager to learn
	- Humble and unafraid to ask questions and admit mistakes

	- We are looking to hire an FPGA Engineer to help us design, test and deploy advanced hardware accelerators. You’ll be part of the ultra low latency team, but you’ll have the opportunity to collaborate with people in areas across the firm, including trading, networking, and research infrastructure.
	- We’re big believers in the ability of tools to improve the productivity, reliability, and day to day joy of hardware engineering. That’s why we created Hardcaml, a hardware development toolchain embedded in OCaml. We don’t expect you to know OCaml (we’ll teach you here), but we are looking for hardware engineers who are excited about the advantages that better tools can bring, and as a result willing to try new things.
	- In terms of qualifications, we’re looking for someone with:
	- Practical experience of RTL design and testing
	- Experience with backend tooling like Vivado and Quartus
	- An interest in using software engineering techniques to improve the hardware design process, and experience programming in some high-level language (Python, C++, Java, Haskell, etc.)
	- Fluency in English is required

+ Mixed-Signal Circuit Techniques for Near-Sensor Machine Learning and Data Analysis
	- Mixed-signal interfaces are the essential bridges between the physical world and the digital information processing backbone. In recent years, innovation in such interfaces has been increasingly fueled by application-level insight and the data-driven nature of modern systems. As a result, the traditional building block boundaries are blurring, and the extraction of information occurs through symbiotic interplay between analog and digital signal processing. In this talk, I will illustrate this trend using examples of small-scale machine learning and data analysis functions that operate at the physical interface. Specific examples include mixed-signal feature extraction circuits and compute fabric for machine learning inference, as well as data-compressive interfaces for high-dimensional sensor inputs.
