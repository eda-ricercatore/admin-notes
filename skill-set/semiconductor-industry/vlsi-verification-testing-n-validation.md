#	VLSI Power Verification

+ Power Verification Engineer
	- We are looking for an experienced engineer to join a growing CPU/SoC verification team working on a new line of complex SoC devices for AI applications. You will join a team responsible for exhaustively verifying the architecture and microarchitecture of the CPU, as well as its integration into the larger SoC. We are looking for highly talented, passionate, and versatile engineers that can push hardware to highest performance and quality standards.
	- Within this role, the candidate would work closely with Architecture and RTL teams to verify power intent. In addition, would work closely with the Physical Design team for obtaining inputs for Gate-Level simulations.


Responsibilities

Ownership of the Low Power Verification
Ownership of the Gate-Level Simulations (Gatesim)
Technical ownership of the validation of various functional blocks of the CPU and/or SoC
Documenting testplans and driving reviews of the plans with the design team and architects
Develop validation content like test benches, directed and constrained random assembly tests, and functional coverage
Qualifications 

BS in EE or related technical field
5+ years of experience in CPU/SoC validation
Experience with Low Power Verification and UPF is a plus 
Experience with VCS-NP and VCLP is a plus
Experience with Gate-Level simulations is a plus
Knowledge of CPU and SoC architectures is a plus
Knowledge of high-level verification flow methodology (testplan development, test generation and debug, coverage analysis and closure)
Experience with SystemVerilog and UVM
Experience with C/C++ and assembly
Experience with Python or other scripting languages
Ability to clearly communicate across teams with multidisciplinary backgrounds
Business fluent English
