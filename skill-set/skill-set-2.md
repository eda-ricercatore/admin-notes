+ Mixed-Signal Circuit Techniques for Near-Sensor Machine Learning and Data Analysis
	- Mixed-signal interfaces are the essential bridges between the physical world and the digital information processing backbone. In recent years, innovation in such interfaces has been increasingly fueled by application-level insight and the data-driven nature of modern systems. As a result, the traditional building block boundaries are blurring, and the extraction of information occurs through symbiotic interplay between analog and digital signal processing. In this talk, I will illustrate this trend using examples of small-scale machine learning and data analysis functions that operate at the physical interface. Specific examples include mixed-signal feature extraction circuits and compute fabric for machine learning inference, as well as data-compressive interfaces for high-dimensional sensor inputs.
