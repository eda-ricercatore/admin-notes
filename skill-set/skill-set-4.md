	- GitHub is seeking a research engineer in the area of code intelligence in the office of the CTO (OCTO). OCTO aims to be a meeting place within GitHub for experimentation with new ideas, and for setting the agenda for GitHub’s product several years in advance. OCTO has a small number of permanent research staff, and this position is part of the core OCTO team. The engineer will initially focus on exploring synthesis of code from documentation.
	- Here is some more detail on that initial project - it is just an example of more such projects in future. Recent advances in machine learning models for source code indicate that it is possible to synthesize code just from the signature and docstring of a function. Often better synthesis results are possible by also specifying an example to test synthesized candidates. We’d like to explore how to integrate this functionality into CodeSpaces, so that users can browse alternative solutions synthesized by the model. We’d also like to consider other user experiences for the same functionality, for example in an automated assistant for novice developers.
	- Responsibilities:
		* Design and build user interfaces as outlined above, and experiment with new ideas to embody the new code synthesis technology.
		* Collaborate with early adopters and machine learning experts on improving both the underlying technology and the way users interact with the synthesizer.
		* Participate in all activities of the OCTO at GitHub: organizing webinar series, evaluating project proposals, and disseminating research results.
	- Minimum Qualifications:
		* Ability to quickly create innovative user interfaces and new user experiences.
		* 5+ years experience in creating frontends in production
		* Inclination to prototype quickly and make fast decisions on experiment failure.
		* A creative mindset and good practical skills are more important than formal experience.
	- Preferred Qualifications:
		* Experience with user interface design, especially for developer tools.
		* Proven track record of working with early adopters to refine initial designs.
		* Ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, both in spoken and written form, for expert as well as novice audiences.
		* Interest in modern AI technologies and their use in developer tools.

OCTO aims to be a meeting place within GitHub for experimentation with new ideas, and for setting the agenda for GitHub’s product several years in advance. OCTO has a small number of permanent research staff, and this position is part of the core OCTO team. The engineer will initially focus on user interfaces for code synthesis.
	- Here is some more detail on that initial project - it’s just an example of similar projects in future. To train machine learning models for program synthesis, we can use existing code bases and their unit tests: find a function that has good test coverage and documentation, mask out the body, synthesize an alternative implementation, and test it. Applied to all Python and JavaScript code on GitHub, this would be a huge training set. Full unit tests can however be slow to execute, and for effectively training machine learning models we need the tests to be as fast as possible. One way might be to distill the unit tests into ‘micro tests’ by recording just enough state and I/O behavior so we can replay previous behaviors.
	- Responsibilities:
		* Design and build a framework for creating fast functional correctness tests of Python and JavaScript code.
		* Collaborate with machine learning experts on applying this framework for reinforcement learning on program synthesis tasks.
		* Participate in all activities of the OCTO at GitHub: organizing webinar series, evaluating project proposals, and disseminating research results.
	- Minimum Qualifications:
		* Ability to do innovative research on one of the following topics: dynamic analysis, instrumentation, or runtime verification.
		* 5+ years experience building developer tools in production
		* Inclination to prototype quickly and make fast decisions on experiment failure.
		* A creative mindset and good practical skills are more important than formal experience.
	- Preferred Qualifications:
		* PhD in computer science or related field, or other evidence of the ability to do independent research.
		* Knowledge of Python or JavaScript and its ecosystem, or the ability to acquire such knowledge quickly.
		* Ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, both in spoken and written form, for expert as well as novice audiences.

	- You’ll work with a small team of researchers to explore the future of software development in order to guide GitHub’s product and engineering decision-making. Your north star is ensuring that GitHub remains at the heart of software development. Your secondary goal is to project GitHub’s technical prowess — our published work should be inspirational, insightful, and informative to developers everywhere.
	- Responsibilities:
		* Research Engineers conduct investigations and build prototypes. With few constraints on our solution space, our hardest task is scoping our research so that we are able to produce impactful results. We will have an order of magnitude more ideas than we are able to pursue; choosing wisely is part of the job.
		* The domains of exploration are varied and will require an ability to understand, investigate, and implement prototypes across a wide range of technologies.
		* We do not work with production GitHub systems; our focus is on innovation and velocity. If we do our jobs well, we provide a map of the territory that de-risks engineering projects. From time to time, we may be called upon to investigate specific, high-priority topics.
	- Minimum Qualifications:
		* These are the general qualities that candidates must possess in order to succeed in this role.
			+ Comfortable identifying and justifying research goals in situations of ambiguity, and executing towards those goals without explicit direction.
			+ Finds ways to build prototypes that clearly articulate a thesis to others. Able to prototype quickly and evaluate ideas strategically.
			+ Is an effective and inclusive communicator, comfortable with remote communication practices. OCTO’s currency is ideas; the health of our team, our execution, and our results rests on our ability to communicate well.
			+ Able to collaborate with members of OCTO and the broader GitHub Engineering community to identify fruitful areas of investigation, inform OCTO’s point of view on issues/opportunities, and define projects to enhance our understanding of these topics.
			+ Comfortable managing interactions with stakeholders around timelines and milestones. Proactive, consistent communications are key to our working relationships, and a good guardrail against rabbitholes.
			+ 5+ years of experience writing and shipping software. This is a senior engineering role! That said, we are not primarily looking for raw coding ability. Experience is about more than your ability to write code and debate the finer points of $LANGUAGE_FEATURE.
			+ Are a generalist with some areas of deeper knowledge. We will also consider candidates who have specialized in a relevant field.
	- Preferred Qualifications:
		* These are more specific abilities we’re looking for, but it is the rare human who possesses them all. Think of this as a descriptive sketch, not a checklist of requirements. Be comfortable applying even if you don’t have all of them.
			+ A deep understanding of GitHub’s industry and business context, and the ability to be articulate about topics related to our product and audience.
			+ Has held roles that deal with topics at the boundary of human knowledge regarding software development and developers.
			+ A demonstrated ability to ship software using a variety of technology stacks. You are not afraid to read source code. You are comfortable picking up new technology stacks in the normal course of work.
			+ Have significant experience with one or more frontend technologies. We currently default to Typescript and React for the web, but “whatever helps us ship” is the top concern.
			+ Have significant experience with one or more backend technologies: server-side environments, compute, datastores, networking, infrastructure, devops, security.
			+ Have significant experience with open-source software, communities, and the systems that these communities use to self-organize and ship software for others to use.
			+ Have significant experience operating production systems at a nontrivial scale, and are familiar with the common patterns and pitfalls of that work.
			+ Have significant experience in another area of computing that is relevant to our mission. Human-computer interaction, distributed systems, $YOURTHING.
