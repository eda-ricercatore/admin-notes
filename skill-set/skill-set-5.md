		* You'll be working with a great team who love to share ideas, learn, and use new technologies.
		* You'll be influencing the product by continuously providing feedback on the design, workflow process, and testing.
		* You'll be contributing to technical and architectural discussions with the whole Engineering team both on a running basis and at our quarterly engineering off-site.
		* Your code will help our researchers and insights journalists achieve transparency into important personnel related movements using web crawling and machine learning. You'll also help our users attract and align talent by enabling multiplayer org chart building and by supplying community building tools.
		* You'll get at great insight the array of technologies in AWS that we use to continuously deploy and host our services. These are built and deployed using CodePipeline and they communicate via SQS. Our main processes are running Scala services, using Akka/Sangria/Cats, Postgres, Redis and ElasticSearch and are deployed using the Elastic Beanstalk. For periodically running jobs we use ECS.
			+ CodePipeline
			+ SQS is a message queuing service. It exchanges and stores messages between software components. The service adds the messages in a queue. Users or services pick up the messages from the queue. Once processed the messages gets deleted from the queue.
				- Amazon Simple Queue Service is a distributed message queuing service introduced by Amazon.com as a beta in late 2004, and generally available in mid 2006. It supports programmatic sending of messages via web service applications as a way to communicate over the Internet.
			+ Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications for Java and Scala.
				- https://index.scala-lang.org/sangria-graphql/sangria
				- AKKA accelerates innovation and time-to-market of products and services for the digital industrial world
				- As a global leader in engineering consulting and R&D services, AKKA supports the world's leading industry players in their digital transformation and throughout their entire product life cycle.
			+ Sangria is a Scala GraphQL implementation.
				- It is an example of a GraphQL server written with the Play framework and Sangria. It also serves as a playground, where you can interactively execute GraphQL queries and play with some examples.
				- Apollo Client is a full featured, simple to use GraphQL client with convenient integrations for popular view layers. Apollo Client is an easy way to get started with Sangria as they’re 100% compatible.
				- GraphQL is a data query language. It was developed by Facebook and in July 2015 a first draft of the specification was released publicly.
