	- Since antiquity, when sea routes and land routes were perilous for people and goods, having up to date and highly accurate maps have been a requirement for safe travel. These maps were patchworks of military sketches, captain logs, and merchant updates, and over the centuries became more and more detailed. In an era of growing vehicle automation, having up-to-date and highly accurate maps is equally critical to ensuring safe vehicle operation both on the highway and on surface roads. Yet map building remains an extensive and highly manual process, meaning real-time high definition map updates often propagate through to the user with a delay of months or years from the date when they were collected, rendering them useless beyond limited driver-assist functions. It is time for a new paradigm.

+ skill set:
	- At Ashby, we’re on a mission to help professionals excel at their jobs with software. We believe current software is barely scratching the surface and the most promising productivity improvements haven’t materialized yet.
	- We’re starting with a suite of products that help talent leaders, recruiters, and managers excel at hiring. Prior to starting Ashby, our Co-Founder and CEO, Benji, experienced the limitations of current products first hand. This experience has created a relentless focus to solve recruiting’s toughest problems with powerful and delightful software.
	- We’ve not launched publicly yet, but we already have amazing (paying) customers, such as Opendoor, Plaid, Figma, Airtable, Snyk, and Benchling and we’re backed by great investors, including YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. We’ll share more once we meet.
	- We've only scratched the surface of how Ashby can help our customers, it's the perfect time to join.
	- Here are a few key points that should give you an idea of what it is like to work with us:
		* We invest a lot in common building blocks that allow us to build powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is an in-house design system and a set of common components (analytics modelling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine) which we are constantly improving.
		* Customers use Ashby every day, so we put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.
		* We strongly believe that small teams with very talented people (and the right work environment) deliver much better performance than teams with large headcount. We hire and compensate accordingly.
		* Our users’ pain is our pain. Engineers conduct user interviews, slack with our customers, and work closely with them to define, design, and implement solutions.
		* We rigorously protect the team’s time so we can maximize our impact. We invest a lot in asynchronous communication, automation, and research. 
	- We value a strong sense of ownership, principled thinking over experience, and thoughtful communication (we put a lot of effort into using the right communication channels) - we’ll get into these and other values during the hiring process.
	- We believe the best designs come from engineers with an eye for visual design; we don’t have designers who can’t code at Ashby. In particular, we love people who have a deep understanding of CSS and experience building reusable and extensible components.
	- As a design engineer, you will lead the visual and experience design of our design system, its translation to React components, and consult or lead design for new features. We love to work with engineers who are product and design-minded.
	- Our technology stack is: SCSS (with CSS modules) or Stitches, TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis. You’ll be our resident expert on frontend technology and best practices like React, CSS, semantic HTML, and accessibility.
	- One formality, we require at least 1.5 years of experience as a full-time software engineer or designer for this role.
	- You Could Be a Great Fit If
		* Empowering other engineers to build well-designed features through a design system excites you.
		* You believe great visual design balances usability and beauty; you’ll, for example, pick a less appealing interface that packs more information on screen over one that doesn’t.
		* You lean heavily on design patterns and systems but know when a feature needs bespoke work.
		* You believe great design comes through iteration, collaboration, and responding to customer feedback.
		* Every time you see a great design or interaction on the web, your first reaction is to open the developer console.
	- We know this kind of talent is rare and we're excited to pay top of market to have you join us!
	- Here are examples of things you’ll work on:
		* Build a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes that can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.
		* Redesign our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.
		* Consult with other engineers to improve the UX and visual design of projects they’ve worked on.
	- Your First Two Months at Ashby
		* By the end of your second month, you’ll deliver at least one large, impactful feature from research to specification to delivery. We’ll help get you there by pairing you with another engineer to onboard you and introduce you to how Ashby delivers impactful changes to customers. On your first day, they’ll help you run a script to get your dev environment setup (it’s that easy!) and commit your first change to production. In your first two weeks, the team will introduce you to our customers, our product, and key architecture through training sessions. You’ll also fix bugs and add small features to Ashby to get familiar with our code base. From there, you’ll take on projects of increasing scope (with guidance from your onboarding engineer) until you’re ready to take on your large, impactful feature.
	- Benefits
		* You’ll get the time to do things the right way; we put a lot of emphasis on high quality work and avoid quick hacks as much as possible
		* You get to use your own product (we use Ashby for our own hiring!)
		* Top-of-market compensation including equity. We know this kind of talent is rare!
		* 10 year exercise window for stock options
		* Top notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us (U.S.)
		* 401(k) matching (U.S.)
+ skill set:
	- You will define and own the future of developer experience at Ashby. You’ll spend most of your time making our engineering team more productive. You should have a strong desire to identify pain points in our current engineering workflows (e.g. CI takes a long time to run due to a very large test suite) and drastically improve them.
	- You’ll also be responsible for helping our team build reliable & scalable products. We invest heavily in observability and streamlined operations of our products and you will be the point person leading these efforts.
	- Our technology stack is: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.

		* You are persistent in pursuing optimal solutions, even if they are challenging
		* Big bonus if you have contributed to open source projects and/or have written or spoken about relevant tooling issues in the past
		* Beyond the above, we believe that this series of tweets is a great summary of what makes an amazing software engineer. We know this kind of talent is rare and we're excited to pay top of market to have you join us!
	- Examples of Things You’ll Work On
		* Design and implement a generalized worker infrastructure and API so developers can easily run and monitor async tasks immediately, at a later time, or on a schedule.
		* Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs, and work on implementing the corresponding SLIs.
		* Build a CLI tool that runs our development environment and allows engineers to register required or optional services without modifying the CLI source code.
		* Reduce our CI build time by parallelizing tests and other processes using services like GitHub Actions.
