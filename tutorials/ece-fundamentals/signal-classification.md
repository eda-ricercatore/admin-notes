#	Signal Classification



Table of Signal Classification
|						| **continuous-amplitude**	| **discrete-amplitude**	|
| ---------------------	| -------------------------	|---------------------------|
| **continuous-time**	| analog					| amplitude quantized		|
| **dicrete-time**		| sampled signals			| digital					|




Classification of signals is carried out by the time dimension (vertical classification) and the amplitude dimension (horizontal classification).

Sampled signals are time-quantized.

Amplitude quantized signals are sampled data signals.
